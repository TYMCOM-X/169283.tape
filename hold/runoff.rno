^^NOTICE: T\\HIS MEMORANDUM DESCRIBES A PROGRAM WHICH
^DIGITAL ^EQUIPMENT ^CORPORATION HAS NO COMMITTMENT
TO OFFER OR SUPPORT AT THIS TIME. ^THIS MEMORANDUM
IS, HOWEVER, BELIEVED TO BE AN ACCURATE 
DESCRIPTION OF ^^RUNOFF\\.
.PAGE
.PARAGRAPH 0
^^RUNOFF\\ IS A ^^PDP\\-10 PROGRAM TO FACILITATE THE
PREPARATION OF TYPED OR PRINTED MANUSCRIPTS, SUCH AS MEMOS,
MANUALS, ETC.  ^THE USER PREPARES HIS MATERIAL ON ANY
REGULAR ^^PDP\\-10 TERMINAL, AND WRITES IT ONTO A FILE USING
^^TECO \\ OR ^^LINED\\.  ^THE USER INCLUDES NOT ONLY
TEXTUAL MATERIAL, BUT ALSO CASE AND FORMATTING INFORMATION.
^^RUNOFF\\ THEN TAKES THE FILE AND REPRODUCES IT ONTO THE
LINE PRINTER, TELETYPE OR OTHER FILE TO PRODUCE A FINAL COPY
OR FINAL FILE IMAGE.  ^IT PERFORMS THE FORMATTING AND
CASE SHIFTING AS DIRECTED, AND WILL ALSO PERFORM LINE
JUSTIFICATION, PAGE NUMBERING AND TITLING, ETC.,
AS DESIRED.
.PARAGRAPH
^THE PRINCIPAL BENEFIT OF SUCH A PROGRAM IS THAT FILES
PREPARED FOR USE WITH IT MAY BE EDITED AND CORRECTED EASILY.
^SMALL OR LARGE AMOUNTS OF MATERIAL MAY BE ADDED OR DELETED, AND
UNCHANGED MATERIAL NEED NOT BE RETYPED.
^AFTER A SET OF CHANGES, THE PROGRAM MAY BE OPERATED TO
PRODUCE A NEW COPY WHICH IS PROPERLY PAGED AND FORMATTED.
^DOCUMENTATION MAY THUS BE UPDATED AS NECESSARY WITHOUT
REQUIRING EXTENSIVE RETYPING.

.PARAGRAPH
^^RUNOFF\\ IS A SHARABLE PROGRAM MUCH LIKE MOST ^^PDP-10\\
CUSPS. ^IT IS ACCESSED BY THE USUAL "^R" OR "^R^U^N" COMMANDS
TO THE MONITOR.
.SKIP 1
^THE PROGRAM WILL FIRST RESPOND WITH ITS TITLE AND VERSION NUMBER, AND
THEN ASK:
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 10
^^INPUT FILE:\\
.SKIP 1
.INDEX ^SOURCE FILE NAME
^THE SOURCE FILE DESCRIPTOR (DEVICE, NAME, AND EXTENSION) SHOULD THEN BE TYPED.
^THE DEFAULT EXTENSION FOR ^^RUNOFF\\ SOURCE FILES
IS ^^.RNO\\ .
^IF THE NAME IS
TERMINATED WITH AN ALTMODE, THE OUTPUT FILE WILL BE WRITTEN ON
THE DISK IN NORMAL MODE AND OPERATION WILL
COMMENCE.  ^IF A CARRIAGE RETURN IS TYPED, THE PROGRAM WILL THEN ASK:
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 10
^^OUTPUT FILE:\\
.INDEX ^OUTPUT
.SKIP 1
^THE DESTINATION FILE DESCRIPTOR SHOULD BE TYPED.
^THE DESTINATION DEVICE MAY BE ^^TTY:\\,
THE TELETYPE, WHICH IS LIMITED  IN THAT ALL LETTERS ARE UPPER
CASE, AND UNDERLINING IS NOT AVAILABLE.
(^THESE RESTRICTIONS DO NOT APPLY TO SOME MORE ELABORATE
TELETYPE-LIKE TERMINALS.)
  ^ALTERNATELY, A DISK FILE NAME OR OTHER DEVICE AND
FILE NAME MAY BE GIVEN, AND THE
FINAL IMAGE WILL BE WRITTEN ONTO IT.
.PARAGRAPH
^IF THE OUTPUT FILE NAME IS TERMINATED BY AN ALTMODE, THE FOLLOWING
QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE ASKED, AND NORMAL MODE WILL BE ASSUMED.
^IF THE NAME IS TERMINATED WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN,
THE PROGRAM WILL ASK:
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 10
^^UNDERSCORE (L, C, B OR N)?\\
.INDEX ^UNDERSCORING
.SKIP 1
TO WHICH THE USER MUST REPLY ^L, ^C, ^B, OR ^N. ^L (^^LINE\\)
IS NORMAL, AND IS USED FOR
A LINE PRINTER WITH UNDERLINING
OR FOR FILES WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY BE
COPIED TO SUCH A LINE PRINTER. ^IT CAUSES UNDERSCORING
(WHERE SPECIFIED BY _&) TO BE DONE BY OVERPRINTING A LINE.
^C (^^CHARACTER\\) IS USED FOR FILES WHICH WILL BE PRINTED WITH A
.INDEX ^FLEXOWRITER
FLEXOWRITER OR ANY OTHER DEVICE WHICH HAS A NON-SPACING
UNDERSCORE CHARACTER.
^B (^^BACKSPACE\\) CAUSES EACH UNDERLINE CHARACTER IN THE
OUTPUT FILE TO BE FOLLOWED BY A BACKSPACE CHARACTER. ^THIS MODE
SHOULD BE USED FOR TERMINALS WHICH HAVE BOTH A SPACING
UNDERSCORE AND A BACKSPACE FUNCTION.
^N (^^NO\\) CAUSES UNDERLINING REQUESTS TO BE DISCARDED.
.SKIP 1
^THE PROGRAM WILL NEXT ASK:
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 10
^^SIMULATE FORM FEED (Y OR N)?\\
.INDEX ^FORM FEED MODE
.SKIP 1
TO WHICH THE USER MUST REPLY ^Y OR ^N. ^^NO\\ IS NORMAL AND
MEANS THAT A FORM-FEED CHARACTER (CONTROL-^L) WILL BE USED
TO ADVANCE THE LISTING TO THE TOP OF A PAGE. ^THIS MODE
SHOULD BE USED FOR THE LINE PRINTER AND FOR FILES INTENDED
FOR THE FLEXOWRITER.
.INDEX ^FLEXOWRITER
  ^^YES\\ MEANS THAT THE PROGRAM WILL ADVANCE
TO A NEW PAGE BY TYPING AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF LINE-FEED
CHARACTERS.  ^IT MUST BE USED WITH ANY DEVICE WHICH DOES
NOT HAVE MECHANICAL PAGE ADVANCE BUILT IN.
.PARAGRAPH
^THE PROGRAM WILL
THEN ASK:
.SKIP 1
.INDENT 10
^^PAUSE?\\
.SKIP 1
^A ^^YES\\ ANSWER MEANS THAT THE PROGRAM WILL STOP AT THE TOP OF
EACH PAGE TO ALLOW THE PAPER TO BE POSITIONED MANUALLY. 
^THE USER SHOULD TYPE  A SPACE TO
CAUSE PRINTING TO BE RESUMED.
^THIS MODE IS APPROPRIATE FOR TYPING THE OUTPUT ONTO PAGES
OF DUPLICATING MASTERS.
.PARAGRAPH
^WHEN THE PROGRAM HAS COMPLETED PROCESSING, IT WILL TYPE ^^DONE\\,
AND RETURN TO MONITOR LEVEL.

^^SOURCE FILE FORMAT\\
.INDEX ^SOURCE FILE FORMAT
.PARAGRAPH
^AS STATED ABOVE, THE SOURCE FILE CONTAINS THE TEXTUAL MATERIAL
WHICH WILL APPEAR ON THE FINAL COPY, PLUS INFORMATION TO
SPECIFY FORMATTING.  ^MOST IMPORTANTLY, UPPER AND LOWER CASE
INFORMATION MAY ALSO BE SUPPLIED SO THAT COPY CAN BE PREPARED ON
THE TELETYPE OR OTHER SUCH DEVICE WHICH CAN NORMALLY INPUT ONLY
UPPER CASE LETTERS.  ^ALL COMMAND INFORMATION CONSISTS
OF REGULAR ^^ASCII\\ PRINTING CHARACTERS SO THAT A LISTING OF
THE SOURCE FILE MAY BE EXAMINED IF THE FINAL COPY IS NOT
EXACTLY AS DESIRED.
.PARAGRAPH
^ALL MATERIAL IN THE SOURCE FILE IS TAKEN TO BE SOURCE TEXT
EXCEPT THOSE LINES BEGINNING WITH A PERIOD.  ^A LINE BEGINNING
WITH A PERIOD IS ASSUMED TO BE A COMMAND,
.INDEX ^COMMAND FORMAT
 AND MUST MATCH ONE
OF THOSE LISTED BELOW.  ^THE COMMANDS PROVIDE THE FORMATTING
INFORMATION, AND CONTROL VARIOUS OPTIONAL MODES OF OPERATION.
.PARAGRAPH
^USUALLY THE TEXT IS FILLED
.INDEX ^FILLING OF TEXT
 AND JUSTIFIED
.INDEX ^JUSTIFICATION OF TEXT
 AS IT IS PROCESSED.
^THAT IS, THE PROGRAM ^^FILLS\\ A LINE BY ADDING SUCCESSIVE WORDS
FROM THE SOURCE TEXT UNTIL ONE MORE WORD WOULD CAUSE THE RIGHT
MARGIN TO BE EXCEEDED.  ^THE LINE IS THEN ^^JUSTIFIED\\ BY
MAKING THE WORD SPACINGS LARGER UNTIL THE LAST WORD IN THE LINE
EXACTLY MEETS THE RIGHT MARGIN.
.PARAGRAPH
^THE USER MAY OCCASIONALLY WISH TO REPRODUCE THE SOURCE TEXT
EXACTLY WHICH IS DONE BY
DISABLING FILLING AND JUSTIFICATION.  ^THE PROGRAM MAY BE SET
TO FILL BUT NOT JUSTIFY, IN WHICH CASE THE OUTPUT WILL BE 
NORMAL EXCEPT THAT LINES WILL NOT BE JUSTIFIED TO THE RIGHT MARGIN.
^THE PROGRAM MAY ALSO BE SET TO JUSTIFY BUT NOT FILL, 
ALTHOUGH THIS WOULD PROBABLY PRODUCE PECULIAR RESULTS AND
IS NOT RECOMMENDED.
.PARAGRAPH
^WHEN THE FILL MODE IS ON, SPACES
.INDEX ^SPACE
.INDEX ^WORD SPACING
 AND CARRIAGE RETURNS 
OCCURRING IN THE SOURCE TEXT ARE TREATED ONLY AS WORD
SEPARATORS.  ^MULTIPLE SEPARATORS ARE IGNORED.
.PARAGRAPH
^SOME OF THE COMMANDS CAUSE A ^^BREAK\\
.INDEX ^BREAK
 IN THE
OUTPUT.  ^A BREAK MEANS THAT THE CURRENT LINE IS OUTPUT WITHOUT
JUSTIFICATION, AND THE NEXT WORD GOES AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE NEXT LINE.  ^THIS OCCURS AT THE END OF PARAGRAPHS.
.PARAGRAPH
^THE PROGRAM WILL ADVANCE TO NEW PAGES AS NECESSARY, PLACING
.INDEX ^PAGE ^NUMBERING
.INDEX ^TITLE
THE TITLE (IF GIVEN) AND THE PAGE NUMBER AT THE TOP OF EACH

^^CASE INFORMATION\\
.INDEX ^CASE SPECIFYING
.PARAGRAPH
^SPECIFICATION OF CASE FOR FILES PREPARED ON THE TELETYPE IS
DONE WITH TWO CHARACTERS, UP-ARROW
(_^, SHIFT-^N), AND BACK-SLASH (_\, SHIFT-^L).
^THE APPEARANCE OF AN UP-ARROW CAUSES THE LETTER IMMEDIATELY
FOLLOWING TO BE TRANSMITTED IN UPPER CASE.  ^THE APPEARANCE
OF A BACK-SLASH CAUSES THE LETTER IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING TO
BE CONVERTED TO LOWER CASE.  ^ANY LETTER NOT PRECEEDED BY ONE OF
THESE CHARACTERS IS TRANSMITTED IN THE CURRENT MODE.  ^THE MODE
IS INITIALLY LOWER CASE, AND IS CHANGED BY THE OCCURRANCE
OF TWO SUCCESSIVE CASE CONTROL CHARACTERS.  ^TWO 
UP-ARROWS (_^_^) CAUSE THE MODE TO BE SET TO UPPER CASE,
AND TWO BACK-SLASHES (_\_\) CAUSE THE MODE TO BE SET TO
LOWER CASE.
.PARAGRAPH
^THE USE OF THE ABOVE CORRESPONDS TO THE USE OF THE SHIFT AND
SHIFT-LOCK KEYS ON A TYPEWRITER.  ^USUALLY, TYPING APPEARS
IN LOWER CASE. ^TO TYPE ONE LETTER IN UPPER CASE, THE SHIFT
KEY IS USED.  ^THE SHIFT-LOCK IS SET TO TYPE A SERIES OF
UPPER CASE LETTERS, AFTER WHICH IT IS RELEASED.
.PARAGRAPH
^THE FOLLOWING SHOWS THE USES OF THE CASE CONTROL CHARACTERS:
.SKIP 1
^^_^HERE IS A _^SAMPLE _^SENTENCE IN _^_^UPPER CASE_\_\ AND
LOWER CASE.
\\

BECOMES:
.SKIP 1
^HERE IS A ^SAMPLE ^SENTENCE IN ^^UPPER CASE\\ AND LOWER CASE.
.PARAGRAPH

^NOTE: ^CASE CONVERSION TAKES PLACE ONLY ON ^^ASCII\\
CODES 101 TO 132 OCTAL, THAT IS, THE UPPER CASE LETTERS.  ^ANY
ACTUAL LOWER CASE LETTERS (CODES 141 TO 172 OCTAL) APPEARING
IN THE SOURCE WILL BE TRANSMITTED UNCHANGED.  ^IF THE SOURCE
IS PREPARED ON A DEVICE SUCH AS A FLEXOWRITER
OR MODEL 37 TELETYPE WHICH PRODUCES
LETTERS OF THE PROPER CASE, THE MODE SHOULD BE SET TO
UPPER CASE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FILE AND LEFT UNCHANGED FOR
THE REMAINDER.

^SPECIAL ^CHARACTERS
.INDEX ^SPECIAL ^CHARACTERS
.PARAGRAPH
^THE CHARACTER AMPERSAND (_&, SHIFT-6) IS USED TO SPECIFY
UNDERSCORING.
.INDEX ^UNDERSCORING
^THE AMPERSAND WILL CAUSE THE CHARACTER FOLLOWING IT TO BE
UNDERSCORED, E.G. _&F_&O_&O BECOMES ^&FOO\&.
.PARAGRAPH
^UNDERLINING OF A STRING OF CHARACTERS CAN ALSO BE SPECIFIED,
SIMILARLY TO THE USE OF THE SHIFT LOCK OPERATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
 ^AN
APPEARANCE OF AMPERSAND PRECEDED BY UP-ARROW (_^_&) WILL
CAUSE UNDERLINING OF ALL FOLLOWING CHARACTERS EXCEPT SPACE. ^AN
APPEARANCE OF AMPERSAND PRECEDED BY BACKSLASH (_\_&) WILL
DISABLE THIS MODE.
.PARAGRAPH
^THE PRESENT VERSION OF ^^RUNOFF\\ USES THE ^^ASCII\\ CHARACTER
176 FOR AN UNDERLINE, WHICH PRINTS AS A RAISED TILDE ON THE
^^LP-10C\\ PRINTER. ^THIS IS DUE TO THE ERRATIC NATURE OF ^^ASCII\\
ON CERTAIN CHARACTERS SUCH AS UNDERLINE OVER THE YEARS.
^THIS CHARACTER MAY BE CHANGED BY A REASSEMBLY OF RUNOFF
IF NECESSARY.
.PARAGRAPH
.INDEX ^SPACE
.INDEX ^QUOTED ^SPACE
^IT IS OCCASIONALLY NECESSARY TO INCLUDE SPACES IN THE TEXT
WHICH SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS WORD SEPARATORS. ^FOR
THIS PURPOSE, ^^RUNOFF\\ TREATS ^&NUMBERSIGN\& (_#) AS A
QUOTED SPACE; I.E. IT WILL PRINT AS EXACTLY ONE SPACE IN THE
OUTPUT, WILL NEVER BE EXPANDED NOR CHANGED TO A CARRIAGE RETURN.
.PARAGRAPH
^TO ALLOW THE APPEARANCE OF THE SPECIAL CHARACTERS (AMPERSAND,
NUMBER-SIGN, UP-ARROW, OR BACK-SLASH) IN
THE OUTPUT, THE CHARACTER LEFT-ARROW (__, SHIFT-^O) IS USED
AS A QUOTE 
.INDEX ^QUOTE CHARACTER
CHARACTER.  ^THE CHARACTER IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING
A LEFT-ARROW WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE OUTPUT WITH NO
FORMATTING EFFECT.
^THE LEFT ARROW ITSELF IS THUS ANOTHER CASE REQUIRING
QUOTING. ^THE FOLLOWING FIVE CASES OCCUR: ___&,
___^, ___\, ____, AND ___#.

^THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS WILL BE RECOGNIZED IF THEY ARE AT THE
BEGINNING OF A LINE STARTED WITH A PERIOD.  ^ANY LINE IN THE
SOURCE FILE BEGINNING WITH A PERIOD IS ASSUMED TO BE ONE OF
THESE COMMANDS.  ^IF IT IS NOT, AN ERROR DIAGNOSTIC WILL BE
TYPED AND THE LINE WILL BE IGNORED.  ^SOME COMMANDS TAKE ONE
OR MORE DECIMAL NUMBERS FOLLOWING. ^THESE ARE SEPARATED FROM
THE COMMAND BY A SPACE.
