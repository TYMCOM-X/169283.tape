There is no one assigned to this important
project due to a recent resignation.
A replacement RFP is needed immediately, and Marketing
Support should be informed that no support will be
available until six-to-twelve weeks after someone is hired
for this position.
This will be a full-time project for one person
for at least six months, at which time this person
could conceivably take on another project.
