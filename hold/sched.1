THIS IS A LIST OF AT LEAST SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH
REMAIN TO BE DONE ON THE PDP-10 WITH SOME TIME ESTIMATES.

PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME OF THE TIME ESTIMATES WHICH SEEM
LONG ARE DUE TO THE FACT THAT I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT THE PROBLEM
CLOSELY ENOUGH TO MAKE AN ACURATE ESTIMATE AND HAVE THEREFORE
PUT A FAIRLY HIGH UPPER LIMIT ON THE PROJECT.

I DO NOT GUARENTEE ANY OF THE ABOVE ESTIMATES. IF YOU WANT
TO QUOTE ME ON ANY OF THEM IN A SCHEDULE, I WOULD WANT TO TAKE
A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM FIRST.
