
THIS DOCUMENT WILL DESCRIBE EXTENSIONS TO SIMPL AS PROPOSED BY
VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE TECHNICAL DIVISION.
I.

USERS OF SIMPL ON THE PDP10 DESIGNATE THE STARTING LOCATION OF THEIR
PROGRAM BY THE STATEMENT:
\\->ID

WHERE ID IS A LABEL PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED ON THE SAME LEVEL.
IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE TO ALLOW THE STATEMENT
\\-> 

WITHOUT THE ID TO ALSO  DESIGNATE THE STARTING LOCATION IF IT
IMMEDIATELY PRECEDES THE DESIRED STATEMENT.
II.

IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT THE LOCAL AND GLOBAL  STATEMENTS WHICH
HAVE THE FORM :
        LOCAL D1,...,DN
        GLOBAL D1,...,DN
WHERE DI MAY BE AS DEFINED NOW:
        ID
        ID(KONEX1:KONEX2)
        ID(KONEX)
        ID( )
        ID:
        %ID
AND BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE:
        ID[KONEX]
        ID[KONEXI:KONEXJ][KONEX1,...,KONEXN]
        ID(KONEX)[KONEX1,...,KONEXN]
AND THAT THE MEANINGS OF THE ABOVE BE THE SAME AS THE TABLE STATEMENT
EXCEPT THAT THE VARIABLES ARE INITIALIZED IN THE LOW SEGMENT.
LOCAL TABLE WILL BE EQUIVALENT TO TABLE, AND GLOBAL TABLE
WILL BE THE SAME.
III.

IF THE INITIALIZATION OF LOW SEGMENT VALUES IS IMPLEMENTED,THEN
PROCEDURE VALUES COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN A SIMILIAR
MANNER.
E.G %PROCNAME(PARAMETER LIST) WHERE THE PARAMETER LIST COULD BE:
        ID
        @ID
        ID( )
        ID:
        %ID
AS IT IS NOW BUT WITH THE ADDITION OF
        ID[KONEX]
IV.

IT HAS BEEN SUGESTED THAT THE CONCEPT OF RELOCATABLE CONSTANTS
BE EXTENDED. STRING CONSTANTS ARE AN ALREADY EXISTING EXAMPLE
OF THIS GROUP.
THE NEW ADDITIONS WOULD BE @SW,ARRAY NAMES AND LABELS.
THE KONEX CLASSIFICATION  WOULD INCLUDE ALL
CONSTANT EXPRESSIONS WITH A RELOCATION FACTOR OF 0 OR 1.
A SUBSET OF KONEX COULD BE DESCRIBED AS AKONEX OR ABSOLUTE
CONSTANT EXPRESSION AND THOSE STATEMENTS WHICH ALLOW KONEX 
WILL BE REDEFINED TO ALLOW ONLY AKONEX. THEY ARE:
        ARRAY DECLARATIONS,E.G. ID(AKONEX:AKONEX) OR ID (AKONEX)
        BASE AKONEX
        DO AE OF AKONEX1:AKONEXN
        AKONEX:
V.

IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT RECURSIVE PROCEDURES BE IMPLEMENTED
TO DECLARE A PROCEDURE RECURSIVE  A NEW DECLARATION COULD BE INTRODUCED

LOCAL
GLOBAL RECURSIVE P1,...,PN
FIND

A 'STACK' COMMAND  TO SET UP THE SIZE OF THE STACK WOULD BE NECESSARY-

EG. STACK AKONEX
        STACK
 WHERE DEFAULT SIZE COULD BE  100 WORDS

AND PERHAPS :
CLEAR STACK
PUSH STACK AE
POP STACK SW
VI.
IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT PARENTHETIC INPUT ARGUMENTS BE 
ALLOWED FOR MACRO CALLS
AND THAT THE PARENTHESES BE STRIPPED OFF BEFORE SUBSTITUTION TO
ALLOW ARGUMENT VECTORS.

VII.

OTHER SUGGESTIONS HAVE BEEN TO EXTEND SW MODIFICATION TO INCLUDE

SW MIN_AE
SW MAX_AE

AND TO ALLOW SW PART OF DEFERRED ASSIGNMENT TO HAVE SW MODIFICATION
 SW+<==AE
SW-<==AE
SW ABS<==AE
SW BNOT<==AE
SW MIN<==AE
SW MAX<== AE
