This is one of the most fascinating papers that I have ever read.
Not certainly for the conclusions (which are almost anticlimactic),
the paper's appeal lies in three areas: 
        (1) the first-time-ever appearance of the assumptions used
            for the design of the SAFEGUARD Antiballistic
            Missile System's tracking of incoming targets
            (a real mindboggler);
        (2) a well-written description of the Bulk and Kalman filter
            techniques used in target acquisition and tracking; and
        (3) the comparative performance of Goodyear's STARAN, 
            Bell Lab's Parallel Element Processing Ensemble (PEPE),
            and a CDC 7600 on the computational task based on
            (1) (yes, any of the three systems can handle the task).
Some interesting approaches to measuring system efficiency of
parallel processors are given almost incidentally.  This paper is
very much worth reading, especially by those of us who see networks
of slower minicomputers as the wave of the future.
