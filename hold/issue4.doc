                 This document provides  supplementary  information  for
            FASBOL  users.   It  contains  a list of bugs that have been
            found and fixed, and some information to  be  added  to  the
            user's  manual.  This information pertains to Issue 4 of the
            FASBOL software.

                 Bugs that are now fixed


                 The following  compiler  and  runtime  bugs  have  been
            reported, found, and fixed:

                 A garbage collection problem was causing error  21  and
            wasting storage.

                 TABLE(TABLE) was not working and giving error 17.

                 Unevaluated expressions involving function  calls  were
            not being correctly compiled.

                 Integer to real  conversion  in  expressions  and  real
            constants were not being correctly compiled.

                 Real to  string  conversion  was  off  by  1/2  on  the
            fractional part.

                 Arrays of size 1 were not working properly.

                 SIZE(non-string) was giving error 10.

                 Function calls and array references with  more  than  9
            arguments  were  being  incorrectly  compiled  and  losing 2
            arguments.

                 ARRAY to TABLE conversion was not working properly.

                 I/O  did  not  work  on  the  ki10  processor  due   to
            differences in response to illegal memory references.

                 Improvements


                 The following improvements have been added:

                 The syntax for file  name  arguments  to  LOOKUP()  and
            ENTER()   has   been   expanded  to  allow  a  [proj ,prog ]
            specification.  Also, LOOKUP() now fails if the file is  not
            found,  rather  than  giving  an error exit as it has in the
            past; most users seem to prefer this behavior.

                 A new class of library functions, accessible  by  using
            an   EXTERNAL.FUNCTION   declaration,   has  been  added  to
            accomodate new features.  A list of these functions follows.

                 MEMBER(table,key) can be used to directly  replace  any
            occurrence  of  a table reference (i.e.  table<key>), except
            that if the key is not already in the table,  the  reference
            fails  (i.e.  FRETURNs) and a new table entry for the key is
            not created.  A table reference always  suceeds  and  always
            creates  a  new entry if one does not already exist.  Notice
            that, like a table reference, MEMBER() may appear on  either
            the left or right side of an assignment.

                 Additional user information


                 The compiler now accepts  input  lines  of  up  to  132
            characters, instead of truncating at 72.  Additional changes
            have been made to the compiler so that it now takes up about
            2K  less  core  and  is also more stingy about acquiring any
            more  for  symbol  table  expansion.   A   special   version
            (FASBOL.MIN) is available that uses even 1K less core at the
            cost of a dummy cross-reference phase.

                 Two batch control files, MAKSNO.CTL and DELSNO.CTL, are
            included  in  the  directory  to  enable users to build, and
            delete, the intermediate files for the compiler and library.
            MAKSNO.CTL   requires   about  20  min.   of  CPU  time  and
            DELSNO.CTL 4 seconds.

                 An  additional  batch  control  file,  MAKA10.CTL,   is
            included  for  users with a ka10 processor; it will edit and
            rebuild the necessary files for running FASBOL  on  a  ka10.
            MAKA10.CTL must be run before MAKSNO.CTL.

                 There are some additional programming  limitations  not
            mentioned  in the user's manual.  The number of arguments in
            a function call, formal arguments in a function  definition,
            and fields in a datatype definition are limited to a maximum
            of 15; this limitation will be removed in the future.  Also,
            the object of the * (unevaluated expression) operator cannot
            be an explicit pattern structure;  use  LEN(*n)  instead  of
            *LEN(n) and (*pat1 ! *pat2) instead of *(pat1 ! pat2).  This
            will also go away eventually.

                 FASBOL users are encouraged to submit bug  reports  and
            suggestions  for  future  enhancements  (via  DECUS).  A new
            version of FASBOL is being designed, primarily  to  overcome
            the  shortcomings  of  the  present compiler with respect to
            space and speed.  The new compiler will be written in  MACRO
            and  have  shareable  high  segments  that will successively
            overlay each other.   It  will  produce  relocatable  (.REL)
            files  directly,  in  one  pass, and have many new features.
            The projected  size  is  about  8K  pure  (for  the  largest
            overlay)  plus  1K impure plus storage for the symbol table.
            The speed of compilation should be from five  to  ten  times
            faster than the current FASBOL/MACRO combination.
