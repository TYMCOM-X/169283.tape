                PDP-10/620 INTERFACE ASSEMBLY
        
        THIS IS A STEP BY STEP ASSEMBLY PROCEDURE FOR BUILDING A
        PDP-10/620 INTERFACE . ALL QUANTITIES REFER TO THE NUMBER USED
        IN ONE INTERFACE.

        1. BUILD THE FOLLOWING:

                1       ASC66-1/ASD     DEC MX10 CABLE
                1       ASM9-1/ASD      SCANBE CARD CAGE
                1       ASP5-1/ASD      PLUGBOARD CHASSIS AS PER
                                        REQUIREMENT

                1       ASP32-1/ASD     MODEL 4 POWER SUPPLY (POSITIVE)
                1       ASP46-1/ASD     INTERFACE SWITCH PANEL
           IF THE INTERFACE IS TO BE CABLED TO DEC EQUIPEMENT BUILD:
                2       ASC52-1/ASD     PDP-10 MEMORY BUS CABLE
           IF THE INTERFACE IS TO BE CABLED TO ANOTHER INTERFACE BUILD:
                4       ASC79-1/ASD     CARD CAGE TO CARD CAGE BUS CABLE
        2. ASSEMBLE THE FOLLOWING:
           QUANTITY     REFERENCE
                1       ASP23-2/ASD     PDP10/TYMNET INTERFACE CARD CAGE
                                        USING DEC DRIVER, RECEIVER AND
                                        TERMINATER CARDS THAT HAVE BEEN
                                        PRETESTED IN THE CHECKOUT LAB
                                        AND THE POWER CABLE ASC64-1.
                1       ASP36-1/ASD     SINGLE PANEL ASSEMBLY USING THE
                                        ASB33-1 BOARD
                1       VARIAN 620      AS PER CURRENT REQUIREMENTS
        3. ASSEMBLE THE MAIN UNIT AS PER ASY17-1/ASD OR ASY17-2. BECAUSE
           OF SPACE REQUIREMENT , ALL SUBASSEMBLIES MUST BE MOUNTED
           AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THE TOP POWER SUPPLY MUST BE MOUNTED
           AGAINST THE TOP OF THE CABINET. USE NYLON SHOULDER WASHERS
           WHEN MOUNTING THE SINGLE PANEL FRAME TO INSULATE IT FROM
           THE SIDE RAILS. CHECK FOR AN OPEN BETWEEN THE PANEL AND 
           SIDE RAILS.
        4. CABLE THE FOLLOWING:
                A. PLUGBOARD CHASSIS TO THE VARIAN 620 PER REQUIREMENT
                B. E BUS TO THE 023 BOARD OF THE SINGLE PANEL FRAME
                   REFERENCE: ASC24-1/ASD , ASB33-1/ASD
                                J1      TO      X8
                                J2      TO      X7
                C. GROUND, -5V, AND +5V TO THE 023 BOARD.
                   REFERENCE: ASB33-1/ASD , ASC64-1/ASD
                D. SCANBE CARD CAGE TO 023 BOARD
                   REFERENCE: ASP23-2/ASD, ASB33-1/ASD, ASC38-1/ASD
                   LABLE THE 029 CARD OF EACH CABLE WITH ITS LOCATION.
                        CARD CAGE               023 BOARD
                        LOCATION        PLUG    LOCATION
                           C7            1        X13
                           C7            2        X14
                          C18            1        X 9
                          C18            2        X10
                          C31            1        X11
                          C31            2        X12
                E. TIE ALL LOOSE CABLE WITH PLASTIC CABLE TIES.
                F. MOUNT THE INTERFACE SWITCH PANEL (ASP46-1) UNDER THE 
                   CARD CAGE AND INSERT THE 029 BOARD IN LOCATION 1 OF 
                   THE CARD CAGE.
