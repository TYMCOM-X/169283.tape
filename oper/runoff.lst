RUNOFF 11 Jul 72                                    PAGE   2



RUNOFF is a TYMCOM X program to facilitate  the  preparation
of  typed  or  printed  manuscripts, such as specifications,
manuals, etc.  The user prepares his material on a file  and
includes  not  only  textual  material,  but  also  case and
formatting information.  RUNOFF  then  takes  the  file  and
reproduces it onto the terminal or another file to produce a
final copy.  It performs the formatting and case shifting as
directed,  and  will  also  perform line justification, page
numbering and titling, etc., as desired.

The principal benefit  of  such  a  program  is  that  files
prepared for use with it may be edited and corrected easily.
Small or large amounts of material may be added or  deleted,
and  unchanged material need not be retyped.  After a set of
changes, the program may be run to produce a new copy  which
is  properly paged and formatted.  Documentation may thus be
updated as necessary without requiring extensive retyping.


                     On Line Operation

RUNOFF is a program accessed by the usual "R" command to the
MONITOR or TYMEX.  For example, the user would type:

                         -R RUNOFF

The program will first respond with its  title  and  version
number, and then ask:

          INPUT FILE:

The input file name  should  then  be  typed.   The  default
extension  for  RUNOFF  source  files  is  .RNO  and  may be
ommitted if desired.  If the input file name  is  terminated
with  an  altmode  in  MONITOR  mode or a control D in TYMEX
mode, the output file will be written on the disk in  normal
mode  which  is  the input file name with the extension .LST
and the answers all the following  questions  being  NO  and
operation  will  commence.   If  a  carriage return is typed
after the input file name, the program will then ask:

          OUTPUT FILE:

The output  file  name  should  be  entered.   TTY:  may  be
specified  if terminal output is desired.  If a file name is
specified without an extension, the extension '.LST' will be
used.

If the output file name  is  terminated  by  an  altmode  in
MONITOR  mode  or  a  control D in TYMEX mode, the following
questions will  not  be  asked,  and  normal  mode  will  be
assumed.  The normal mode being the answers to the following
question being NO.  If the output file  name  is  terminated

RUNOFF 11 Jul 72                                    PAGE   3



with a carriage return, the program will ask:

          UNDERSCORE (L, C, B OR N)?

_L (LINE) is normal, and is used  for  a  line  printer  with
underlining, a terminal with underlining, or for files which
will  eventually  be  copied  to  such  a  line  printer  or
terminal.   It causes underscoring (where specified by &) to
be done by overprinting a line.

_C (CHARACTER) is used for files which will be printed with a
terminal which has a non-spacing underscore character.

_B (BACKSPACE) causes each underline character in the  output
file  to  be  followed  by a backspace character.  This mode
should be used for  terminals  which  have  both  a  spacing
underscore and a backspace function.

_N (NO) causes underlining requests to be discarded.

Note: If underscoring is going to be used with the B  option
it is suggested that the command TTY WIDTH 177 be used prior
to using runoff.

The program will next ask:

          SIMULATE FORM FEED (Y OR N)?

to which the user must reply Y or N.  NO is normal and means
that  a  form-feed  character  (control-L)  will  be used to
advance the listing to the top of a page.  This mode  should
be  used  for  terminals  with  mechanical form feeds or for
files to be listed on terminals with form  feed  capability.
This  option  may  also  be  used  in files being printed in
EDITOR with the PRINT command.   It  should  be  noted  that
files  to be printed with the PRINT command in EDITOR should
have the page size  reduced  to  54.   YES  means  that  the
program  will advance to a new page by typing an appropriate
number of line-feed characters.  It must be  used  with  any
terminal which does not have mechanical form feed.

The program will then ask:

          PAUSE?

A YES answer means that the program will stop at the top  of
each page to allow the paper to be positioned manually.  The
user should type a space to cause printing  to  be  resumed.
This mode is appropriate for typing the output onto pages of
special forms or materials.

When the program has completed processing, it will type  END
OF JOB, and return to MONITOR mode or TYMEX.

                     SOURCE FILE FORMAT

As stated  above,  the  source  file  contains  the  textual
material   which   will  appear  on  the  final  copy,  plus
information to specify formatting.  Most importantly,  upper
and lower case information may also be supplied so that copy
can be prepared on any  type  terminal  which  can  normally
input  only  upper  case  letters.   All command information
consists of regular ASCII  printing  characters  so  that  a
listing of the source file may be examined if the final copy
is not exactly as desired.

All material in the source file is taken to be  source  text
except   those  lines  beginning  with  a  period.   A  line
beginning with a period is assumed to be a command, and must
match  one  of those listed below.  The commands provide the
formatting information, and control various  optional  modes
of operation.

Usually the text is filled and justified as it is processed.
That is, the program FILLS a line by adding successive words
from the source text until one more  word  would  cause  the
right  margin to be exceeded.  The line is then JUSTIFIED by
making the word spacings larger until the last word  in  the
line exactly meets the right margin.

The user may occasionally wish to reproduce the source  text
exactly   which   is   done   by   disabling   filling   and
justification.  The program may  be  set  to  fill  but  not
justify, in which case the output will be normal except that
lines will not be justified to the right margin.

When the FILL  mode  is  on,  spaces  and  carriage  returns
occurring  in  the  source  text  are  treated  only as word
separators.  Multiple separators are ignored.  However,  two
spaces will be used after a period.

Some of the commands cause a break in the output.   A  break
means that the current line is output without justification,
and the next word goes at the beginning of  the  next  line.
This occurs at the end of paragraphs.

The program will advance to new pages as necessary,  placing
the  title (if given) and the page number at the top of each
page.  The user may explicitly call for a page advance where
desired,  and  may  inhibit the occurrance of a page advance
within specified material.

                      CASE INFORMATION

Specification of case for files prepared on the terminal  is
done with two characters, up-arrow , and back-slash.  If the
input  file  was  created  in  upper  and  lower  case,  the
following  does  not apply.  It should be remembered that it
is necessary, however, to begin the file with two up-arrows.
The  appearance of an up-arrow causes the letter immediately
following to be transmitted in upper case.   The  appearance
of  a  back-slash causes the letter immediately following to
be converted to lower case.  Any letter not preceeded by one
of these characters is transmitted in the current mode.  The
mode  is  initially  lower  case,  and  is  changed  by  the
occurrance  of  two successive case control characters.  Two
up-arrows cause the mode to be set to upper  case,  and  two
back-slashes  cause  the mode to be set to lower case.  This
convention should be used if the file is  created  in  upper
and  lower  case.  If the file contains both upper and lower
case characters, two up-arrows should occur at the beginning
of  the file and thus the remainder of the file will have no
case conversion performed by the program.

The use of the above corresponds to the use of the shift and
shift-lock keys on a typewriter.  Usually, typing appears in
lower case.  To type one letter in upper case, the shift key
is  used.   The  shift-lock is set to type a series of upper
case letters, after which it is released.

Note: Case conversion takes place only on ASCII codes 101 to
132  octal,  that  is,  the  upper case letters.  Any actual
lower case letters (codes 141 to 172 octal) appearing in the
source  will  be  transmitted  unchanged.   If the source is
prepared on a terminal which produces letters of the  proper
case,  the mode should be set to upper case at the beginning
of the file and left unchanged for the remainder.

                     Special Characters

The character _a_m_p_e_r_s_a_n_d is  used  to  specify  underscoring.
The  ampersand  will  cause the character following it to be
underscored, e.g.  &f&o&o becomes _f_o_o.

Underlining of a string of characters can also be specified,
similarly  to the use of the shift lock operations described
above.  An appearance of ampersand preceded by up-arrow will
cause  underlining of all following characters except space.
An  appearance  of  ampersand  preceded  by  backslash  will
disable this mode.

It is occasionally necessary to include spaces in  the  text
which  should  not  be treated as word separators.  For this
purpose, RUNOFF treats _n_u_m_b_e_r_-_s_i_g_n as a quoted  space;  i.e.
it will print as exactly one space in the output, will never
be expanded nor changed to a carriage return.

To  allow  the  appearance   of   the   special   characters
(ampersand,  number-sign,  up-arrow,  or  back-slash) in the
output,  the  character  _l_e_f_t_-_a_r_r_o_w  is  used  as  a   quote
character.  The character immediately following a left-arrow
will be transmitted to the output with no formatting effect.
The  left  arrow  itself  is  thus  another  case  requiring
quoting.

                          COMMANDS

The following commands will be recognized if they are at the
beginning  of a line started with a period.  Any line in the
source file beginning with a period is assumed to be one  of
these  commands.   If it is not, an error diagnostic will be
typed and the line will be ignored.  Some commands take  one
or  more  numbers  following.   These are separated from the
command by a space.


                         Formatting

.BREAK

     Causes a break, i.e.  the current line will  be  output
     with  no justification, and the next word of the source
     text will be placed at the beginning of the next line.

.SKIP n

     Causes a break after which n*(line spacing)  lines  are
     left blank.  If the skip would leave room for less than
     two printed lines on the page (i.e.  if there are  less
     than  n+2*(line  spacing)  lines  left),  the output is
     advanced to the top of the next page.

.BLANK n

     Exactly like SKIP, except that n (rather  than  n*(line
     spacing))  lines  are  specified.   BLANK is used where
     space is to be left independent of  the  line  spacing;
     SKIP, where the space should be relative to the size of
     line space.

.FIGURE n

     Like BLANK except that if less than n lines  remain  on
     the  current  page,  the  page  will be advanced, and n
     blank lines will be left at the top of  the  new  page.
     Principally  used where it is desired to leave room for
     a figure to be drawn in manually.

.INDENT n

     Causes a break and sets the next line to begin n spaces
     to  the right of the left margin.  n may be negative to
     cause the line to begin to the left of the left  margin
     (useful for numbered paragraphs or offset titles).


RUNOFF 11 Jul 72                                    PAGE   8



.PARAGRAPH n

     The number is optional and, if present, sets the number
     of  spaces  which  paragraphs  are to be indented.  The
     initial setting is 5.  The command causes a  break  and
     leaves (m+1)/2 blank lines, where m is the regular line
     spacing.  The next line will be indented  as  indicated
     above.

.PAGE

     Causes a break and an advance  to  a  new  page.   Does
     nothing  if  the  current  page  is empty.  Titling and
     numbering as for automatic page advance.

.TEST PAGE n

     Causes a break followed by a conditional page  advance.
     If  there  are n or more lines remaining on the current
     page, no advance is made  and  no  lines  are  skipped.
     Otherwise,  the  page  is  advanced  as for PAGE.  This
     command should be used to ensure that the  following  N
     lines are all output on the same page.

.NUMBER n

     Turns on page numbering (normal) and, if _n is supplied,
     sets the current page number to _n.

.NONUMBER

     Turns off page numbering.  Pages will  continue  to  be
     counted,  so  the  normal  page  number  will appear if
     numbering is re-enabled.

                        Mode Setting

.JUSTIFY

     Causes a break and sets subsequent output lines  to  be
     justified.  (Initial setting)

.NOJUSTIFY

     Causes a break and prevents justification of subsequent
     output lines.

.FILL

     Causes a break and  specifies  that  subsequent  output
     lines  be  filled.   Sets  the justification mode to be
     that specified by the last  appearance  of  JUSTIFY  or
     NOJUSTIFY.  (Initial setting)

.NOFILL

     Causes a  break  and  prevents  filling  of  subsequent
     output lines.  Also turns off justification.

     Note:

        1. The nofill-nojustify mode need be used only where
           there  are several lines of material to be copied
           exactly.  A single line example will not  require
           using  these  commands if there are breaks before
           and after.

        2. Normally FILL and NOFILL are used  to  turn  both
           filling  and  justification  on  and  off.  It is
           usually  desirable  to  do  both.   A  subsequent
           appearance   of   a  justification  command  will
           override the fill command however.

        3. Because  of  the  action  of   FILL,   a   single
           occurrance  of NOJUSTIFY will cause the remainder
           of the file to be unjustified,  with  filling  as
           specified.  In order to justify but not fill (not
           recommended), a JUSTIFY command must follow every
           NOFILL command.

                     Parameter Settings

.LEFT MARGIN n

     Causes a break after which the left margin is set to n.
     n must be less than the right margin, but not less than
     0.  The initial setting is 0.  The amount of any indent
     plus the left margin must not be less than 0.

.RIGHT MARGIN n

     Causes a break after which the right margin is  set  to
     n.   n  must  be  greater  than  the  left margin.  The
     initial setting is 60.

     The number of characters on a line will be equal to  or
     less  than the right margin minus the left margin minus
     any indenting which may be specified.  Even if  filling
     has  been disabled, lines will not be extended past the
     right margin.

.SPACING n

     Causes a break after which the line spacing will be set
     to  n.   n  must  be  within  the range 1 to 5.  Single
     spacing is 1, double spacing is 2, etc.

.PAPER SIZE n,m

     Sets the number of lines per page  to  n.   n  must  be
     greater  than  10.   The  initial  setting  is  58.   n
     includes the top margin of 5 lines.   The  page  number
     and  title  appear  on  the  second  line.   The second
     argument, m, is optional.   If  present,  it  sets  the
     paper  width  in  columns  (initially  60).  It must be
     greater than the left margin, and it is  set  into  the
     right  margin  as  if a RIGHT MARGIN m command had also
     been typed.  This command is usually used only  at  the
     beginning  of  a  file,  but  may be used throughout if
     needed.

.TAB STOPS n ...  n

     Clears all previous tab stops and sets new tab stops as
     specified.  The several n (max 32) must be greater than
     zero and in increasing order.  They are  the  positions
     of  tab  stops  independent  of the setting of the left
     margin, although any  which  are  less  than  the  left
     margin  will  not  be  seen.   There  are  no tab stops
     initially.

     Tabs should  be  used  only  in  lines  which  will  be
     unjustified   and  unfilled,  i.e.   where  filling  is

RUNOFF 11 Jul 72                                    PAGE  11



     disabled or a break immediately follows.  Clearly,  the
     spaces  specified  by  a  tab  character  should not be
     expanded to justify the line.  This  would  defeat  the
     effect  of  tab formatting.  The appearance of a tab in
     the source text will  be  translated  to  one  or  more
     spaces, the amount necessary to advance to the next tab
     stop.  If a tab appears at a point where no further tab
     stops  have been set on a line, the tab will be treated
     as though it had been a space.

                       Miscellaneous

.TITLE tttt ...  tttt

     This command takes the remaining text on  the  line  as
     the  title.   This  text  will appear at the top of all
     subsequent pages, at position 0,  on  the  second  line
     with the page number.  The title is initially blank.

.SUBTITLE tttt ...  tttt

     This command takes the remaining text on  the  line  as
     the  subtitle.   This  text  will  appear  on  the line
     immediately following the title and page  number.   The
     subtitle  is  initially  blank.   The  subtitle  is not
     indented, but may contain leading spaces to achieve the
     same effect, if desired.

.CENTER n

     This command causes a break after which it centers  the
     next  line following in the source file.  The centering
     is over the column n/2, independent of the  setting  of
     the  left  and  right  margins.   If n is missing, n is
     assumed to be the  paper  width,  initially  60.   (See
     PAPER SIZE command.)

.FOOTNOTE n

     Allocates n*(line spacing) lines at the bottom  of  the
     current  page  for a footnote(1).  If insufficient room
     remains on the current page, space will be allocated at
     the  bottom  of  the  following page.  The text for the
     footnote begins on the line following the command,  and
     it  may contain any appropriate commands (e.g.  CENTER,
     SKIP) necessary to format the footnote.   The  footnote
     is  terminated  by a line beginning with an _e_x_c_l_a_m_a_t_i_o_n
     _p_o_i_n_t (the remainder of which is ignored).   The  lines
     delimited by this line and the FOOTNOTE command are put
     into a buffer to be processed when the output moves  to
     within  the  stated distance of the bottom of the page.
     If a page has multiple footnotes, the  allocated  space
     is  the  sum  of  the  allocations  for  all  footnotes
     assigned to the page.  The user must include his choice
     of footnote-designating symbols within the text.

     The current values of left and right  margin  and  line
     spacing  are  saved  and  restored  after processing of

                   - - - - - - - - - - -
(1) This is a footnote.  This text  and  the  dividing  line
above  were  specified  by  text  and  commands  following a
FOOTNOTE 5 command.

RUNOFF 11 Jul 72                                    PAGE  13



     footnotes.  Therefore, a footnote may contain  commands
     which  change  these parameters, and the effect will be
     limited to the footnote text.

     The actual space taken by the footnote may be  more  or
     less  than that specified by n.  The n merely allocates
     space and should be the user's best guess.   If  it  is
     considerably  off,  the footnote lines may overflow the
     page, or extra space may be left at  the  bottom.   The
     user may wish to adjust n after examining a first draft
     printout.

.INDEX tttt ...  tttt

     This command takes the remaining text on the line as  a
     key  word  or words and adds it, along with the current
     page number, to the internal index buffer.  The command
     does  not  cause a break.  It should appear immediately
     before the item to be indexed.  A key word or words may
     be indexed more than once.

.PRINT INDEX

     Causes  a  break  after  which  it  prints  the  entire
     contents  of  the index buffer.  Entries are printed in
     alphabetical  order,  and  are  set  against  the  left
     margin.   Regular  line  spacing is used, except that a
     blank line is left between entries of  different  first
     letters.   The  number  of the first page on which each
     entry appeared is put on the same line  as  the  entry,
     beginning at the middle of the line (midway between the
     left and right margins).  Additional page  numbers  for
     multiple  entries  follow,  separated  by  commas.  The
     index buffer is left empty.
