        SUBROUTINE GETBIN(NAME,NAMEXT,NGROUP,NUSER,STDMAT,
     +  NUMCOL,NUMROW,RSKMAT,NUMTRI,NUMPRO,IOK)

  THIS ROUTINE READS A BINARY STANDARD REPORT/RISK PROFILE DUMP MODE
  FILE, AND RETURNS THE VALUES READ IN A STANDARD REPORT MATRIX
  AND A RISK PROFILE MATRIX. THE STANDARD REPORT MATRIX SHOULD BE
  DIMENSIONED BY THE CALLING ROUTINE, AND SHOULD BE THE SAME SIZE
  AS THE OVERALL STANDARD REPORT MATRIX THAT WAS SAVED ON THE DUMP
  MODE FILE.  THE RISK PROFILE MATRIX SHOULD BE DIMENSIONED
  BY THE CALLING ROUTINE, AND SHOULD BE AS LARGE (OR LARGER) THAN THE
  RISK PROFILE MATRIX THAT WAS SAVED ON THE DUMP MODE FILE.  THE MAXIMUM
  J SUBSCRIPT OF RSKMAT SHOULD ALWAYS BE 9 (1 PV, 1 FV, 1 IROI, AND
  6 RISK PROFILES), WHILE THE MAXIMUM I SUBSCRIPT SHOULD BE GREATER
  THAN OR EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF TRIALS SAVED ON THE DUMP MODE
  FILE.  (SINCE RSKMAT CAN BE DIMENSIONED LARGER THAN THE NUMBER OF
  TRIALS BEING READ, DIMENSIONS WITHIN RULES FILES CAN BE
  SET TO THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED, AND THE NUMBER OF TRIALS CAN BE VARIED
  WITHOUT REDIMENSIONING THE RSKMAT MATRIX WITHIN THE USER'S MODEL.)
  WHENEVER RSKMAT IS READ, THIS ROUTINE ASSUMES THE INCOMING FILE
  ACTUALLY HAS AS MANY TRIALS AS ARE SPECIFIED BY THE CURRENT
  SETTING OF "NTRIAL" (SET VIA THE TRIALS COMMAND.)  THUS IF TRIALS
  ARE SET TO 50 VIA THE TRIALS COMMAND, A CALL TO GETBIN ASSUMES
  THAT THE INCOMING FILE HAS EXACTLY 50 TRIALS, AND THE FIRST 50 TRIAL
  POSITIONS OF RSKMAT WILL BE FILLED. NTRIAL SHOULD ALWAYS BE SET
  TO THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF TRIALS COMING OFF THE FILE, WHILE THE PASSED
  IN ARGUMENT "NUMTRI" SHOULD BE SET TO THE MAXIMUM SIZE THAT RSKMAT
  IS DIMENSIONED, I.E. >= NTRIAL.

  THIS ROUTINE WILL SETUP THE VALUES LOCATED IN THE MATRIX STDMAT IN
  THE STANDARD REPORT OUTPUT MATRIX FOR OUTPUT. ALSO THE VALUES
  LOCATED IN THE MATRIX RSKMAT ARE SETUP IN THE RISK PROFILE
  OUTPUT MATRIX. STDMAT SHOULD BE DIMENSIONED IN THE CALLING ROUTINE.
  NUMCOL IS THE I SUBSCRIPT MAXIMUM OF STDMAT, AND REPRESENTS THE
  NUMBER OF PERIODS (I.E. NPER). NUMROW IS THE J SUBSCRIPT MAXIMUM
  OF STDMAT, AND REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF ROWS. NUMTRI IS THE MAXIMUM
  I SUBSCRIPT OF RSKMAT, AND REPRESENTS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF TRIALS
  POSSIBLE IN RSKMAT. (THIS ROUTINE ALWAYS ASSUMES "NTRIAL" VALUES
  ARE TO BE SETUP IN THE OUTPUT RISK PROFILE MATRIX.) NUMPRO IS THE
  J SUBSCRIPT MAXIMUM OF RSKMAT, AND SHOULD BE FIXED AT 9. COLUMNS
  WITHIN RSKMAT SHOULD BE ASSIGNED AS FOLLOWS:

           RSKMAT(1-NUMTRI,1)     PV TRIAL VALUES
           RSKMAT(1-NUMTRI,2)     FV TRIAL VALUES
           RSKMAT(1-NUMTRI,3)     ROI TRIAL VALUES / OR IGNORE

  SINCE ROI VALUES ARE NOT ADDITIVE, ONE CANNOT DIRECTLY CALCULATE
  ROI'S FROM ROI'S OF SUBSYSTEMS. THEREFORE, IF IROIOK IS SET TO -1
  THIS ROUTINE IGNORES THE PASSED IN ROI VALUES AND RECALCULATES
  THE ROI OF THE MEAN CASH FLOWS (IF DEFINED BY THE CURRENT REPORT
  SPECIFICATION FILE.) THIS ROI OF THE MEAN IS ASSIGNED TO ALL TRIAL
  VALUES IN THE ROI COLUMN OF THE REPORT MATRIX. IF THE IROIOK VARIABLE
  IS SET TO +1, THIS ROUTINE ASSUMES THE ROI VALUES ARE CORRECT (EITHER
  AGGREGATED VIA SOME MEANS CORRECTLY BY THE USER, OR REPRESENTS A
  NON-AGGREGATED ROI, I.E. AN ROI OF A SINGLE PROJECT RATHER THAN
  THE ROI OF SEVERAL COMBINED PROJECTS), AND THE ROUTINE ASSIGNS
  THE PASSEDVALUES AS THE ROI'S IN THE OUTPUT RISK PROFILE
  MATRIX. IF THE USER ATTEMPTS TO PASS IN A STDMAT OF DIFFERENT
  OVERALL SIZE THAN THE CURRENT STANDARD REPORT, A RSKMAT WITH NUMTRI
  SMALLER THAN THE CURRENT NTRIAL SPECIFICATION, OR A RSKMAT WITH
  NUMPRO NOT EQUAL TO THE FIXED NUMBER OF PROFILES, THE ERROR FLAG,
  IOK, IS SET TO -1, AND NO ASSIGNMENT IS MADE.

        SUBROUTINE GETDEP(METH,PCT,AMOUNT,NOWPER,IPERYR,LIFE,
     +  DEPREC,CUMDEP)



  THIS ROUTINE WILL CALCULATE THE DEPRECIATION FOR ALL PERIODS AND
  THE CORRESPONDING CUMULATIVE DEPRECIATION FOR ANY SINGLE INVESTMENT.
  THREE DIFFERENT DEPRECIATION METHODS ARE PERMITTED:
        1. STRAIGHT LINE
        2. DECLINING BALANCE
        3. SUM-OF-YEARS-DIGITS
  THE INPUT ARGUMENTS ARE:
        1. METH -- THE DEPRECIATION METHOD DESIRED (1,2, OR 3)
        2. PCT -- THE DOUBLE DECLINING PERCENT (IF METH=2)
        3. AMOUNT -- THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO BE DEPRECIATED
        4. NOWPER -- THE FIRST PERIOD TO BEGIN DEPRECIATION
        5. IPERYR -- THE NUMBER OF PERIODS IN A SINGLE YEAR
        6. LIFE -- DEPRECIATION LIFE IN YEARS
  THE VALUES PASSED BACK ARE:
        1. DEPREC -- A VECTOR DIMENSIONED BY THE USER WITH ONE POSITION
                     FOR ALL PERIODS IN THE ANALYSIS (1 THRU NPER)
                     THE VALUES RETURNED IN DEPREC ARE THE DEPRECIATION
                     FOR ANY PERIOD.  DEPRECIATION FOR PERIOD 1 IS
                     THEREFORE DEPREC(1), ETC.
        2. CUMDEP -- A VECTOR DIMENSIONED BY THE USER WITH ONE POSITION
                     FOR ALL PERIODS IN THE ANALYSIS (1 THRU NPER)
                     THE VALUES RETURNED IN CUMDEP ARE THE CUMULATIVE
                     DEPRECIATION AS CALCULATED FOR DEPREC.  THE
                     CUMULATIVE DEPRECIATION FOR PERIOD 1 IS THEREFORE
                     FOUND IN CUMDEP(1), ETC.
  SOME PERTINENT ASSUMPTIONS OF THIS ROUTINE ARE:
        1. PERIODS PRIOR TO NOWPER AND AFTER THE LIFE ARE SET TO ZERO
        2. DECLINING BALANCE DEPRECIATION METHOD SWITCHS TO
           STRAIGHT LINE WHEN THE STRAIGHT LINE DEPRECIATION FOR THE
           NEXT YEAR IS LARGER THAN THAT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN OBTAINED
           VIA THE DECLINING BALANCE METHOD.
        3. IF MORE THAN ONE PERIOD EXISTS WITHIN A YEAR, THE
           DEPRECIATION FOR THE YEAR IS EQUALLY DIVIDED AMONG
           PERIODS IN THE YEAR.

	SUBROUTINE ROUND(IROW,ICOL)

 THIS ROUTINE WILL ROUND A VALUE IN THE R VECTOR TO THE NUMBER

 REPORT SPECIFICATIONS.  THE R POSITION (ROW NUMBER) AND THE
 COLUMN NUMBER ARE PASSED IN, AND THE INDICATED R VALUE IS
 ROUNDED ACCORDINGLY.
