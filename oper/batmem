1.    UPON IMPLEMENTING THE TYMCOM-III SOFTWARE AT BATTELLE, IT WAS
LEARNED THAT THE CDC 6400 DOES NOT ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THE CONTROL 'Z'
CHARACTER USED TO APPLY BACKPRESSURE.  THIS RESULTS IN OCCASIONAL
LOSS OF DATA (BUFFER ZAPS) ON LONG OUTPUT STRINGS.  THE PROBLEM IS
FURTHER COMPLICATED IN THAT WHEN THIS OCCURS, THE SUBSEQUENT CARRIAGE
RETURN NORMALLY USED TO RELEASE BACKPRESSURE THEN HAS THE EFFECT
OF APPLYING BACKPRESSURE.  THIS LEAVES BOTH THE 6400 AND TYMCOM IN A
'HUNG' STATE (IE. THE 6400 WAITING FOR BACKPRESSURE TO BE RELEASED
AND TYMCOM-III WAITING FOR THE REST OF THE OUTPUT STRING).
    TWO DAYS OF ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMING WERE REQUIRED TO CORRECT THIS
PROBLEM.

2.    RE-CODING MADE NECESSARY BY BATTELLES FAILURE TO REVIEW THE
REVISED INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS REQUIRED AN ADDITIONAL WEEK (5 DAYS)
OF PROGRAMMING EFFORT.
    THESE DISCREPANCIES ARE DESCRIBED IN ATTACHMENTS 1 AND 2.
