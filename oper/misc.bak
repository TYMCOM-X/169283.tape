SNAP
.fill
.paragraph
Makes an in core copy of the running supervisor, this copy will then
be used to obtain any further information requested about the supervisor
or network. The routine which makes the copy will check to see
if the supervisor is dormant and if so will print a message to that
effect. Whether the supervisor is dormant or not control will
then be passed back to the command processor so another command
can be executed. The snap routine will also check to see how 
long it has been since the supervisor has run and if more than
1 minute will print a message to that effct.
.paragraph
Unless there is a linefeed waiting in the input buffer when
the program is started up this command will be executed automatically.
If there was a linefeed in the buffer then the user must do a SNAP
or RECOVER before he can do anything else.

SAVE filename

This will write the current snapshot out to filename,
this is not a complete copy of the supervisor but merely
the information that the program needs.(See also DUMP command)

This will dump a complete copy of the supervisor to filename. This
command will require system status in order to execute.

RECOVER filename
.fill
.paragraph
This command will recover a file which has been SAVEd or
DUMPed. After RECOVERing a DUMPed file the program will
be in the same state that it was after the original SNAP.
After RECOVERing a SAVEd file, the program will be in
the same state except that the DUMP and octal printout
commands will not operate..

COUNT
.fill
.paragraph
This will print a count of the number of terminations,
passthroughs, dead ends, duplicate ports and nodes, in the network. If an AN
command had been previously given then the count of 
passthroughs, terminations terminations and nodes will have been 
obtained from it and we can merely get the counts from there.
If this command has not been previously given then we must force
it with no output, as we must search all permuter tables in order
to count the passthroughs and terminations. Likewise if the DE or DP
comand has not previously been issued it will be forced in order to 
count the dead ends or duplicate ports.
