                         OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS


          SYSTAT is called whenever the commands PSP,  SYSNO,  SYSTAT,

          USERS,  WHERE,  or  WHO are typed at command level in either

          MONITOR  mode  or  TYMEX.   Detailed  instructions  for  any

          command  may be obtained by typing the command followed by a

          ? (i.e.  WHO ?).


          SYSTAT will attempt to do output to the logical device  name

          "SYSTAT"  first,  and  then the device name "TTY".  The file

          name SYSTAT.LST will be used on the device  SYSTAT  or  TTY.

          If  the user wants to output to the disk, the following will

          cause  all  SYSTAT  output  to  be  directed  to  the   file

          SYSTAT.LST



                    -ASSIGN DSK SYSTAT
                    DSK ASSIGNED

                    -SYSTAT commands

          NOTE: SYSTAT may be replaced by WHERE, WHO, etc.




          SYSTAT will only output information accessible to the user's

          job through the MONITOR.

                          FIELD CLARIFICATION


          Certain fields typed by  SYSTAT  are  given  an  abbreviated

          form.  These fields are described below.

          NULL TIME = HH:MM:SS


                    This is the total time the NULL JOB  (JOB  0)  has

                    ran.   The  NULL  JOB runs when for some reason no

                    one else can run.

          The TYMNET field consists of the node  from  which  the  job

          being  listed originated from.  This will either be a remote

          name or a base name.  Also given is the teletype  number  of

          the  job, and the letter that was used to identify the job's

          terminal.

          The OPEN FILES LIST is a list of the open files the user  is

          permitted  to  see.   The  only  field  of which requires an

          explanation is the "MODE" field.  There  are  four  possible

          MODES, which are explainged below:





               DUMP      The file is opened with out any  I/O  buffers

                         (DUMP mode).



               IN        The file is opened with just an input buffer.



               OUT       The  file  is  opened  with  just  an  output

                         buffer.



               UPD       The file is opened with both input and output

                         buffers (UPDATE mode).

                     DISK SWITCH - DISK PERFORMANCE





          This switch enables the user with SYSTAT license to look  at

          the  performance of the system's file structures.  Given are

          the names of each pack (both logical and pack i.d.) and  for

          each pack the number of blocks free, the number of reads and

          writes done on that pack, the number of seeks done  on  that

          pack,  and  the errors the MONITOR has detected on that pack

          (if any).   The  following  table  describes  the  different

          errors that can occur:





          CER            Total  number  of  software  folded  checksum

                         failures  (i.e., the first word of a group is

                         not as expected) for both  MONITOR  and  user

                         I/O.



          HDEV           Total number  of  hard  device  errors  (both

                         channel   and   controller)   on  this  unit.

                         Whenever a  hard  device  error  occurs,  the

                         IODERR error status bit is set for the user.



                   NOTE: that all errors except data parity errors are

                         error is a device error.

                         this  unit.   Whenever  a  hard data (parity)

                         error occurs, the IODTER error status bit  is

                         set for the user.



          LBN            Last logical block number  (decimal)  of  the

                         region that had the latest hard data error.

                         a  transfer  done interrupt, and the software
