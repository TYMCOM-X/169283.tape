 THIS PROGRAM WILL FORMAT A MEMO FOR YOU AND PRINT IT EITHER TO THE
 TERMINAL OR A FILE.	IF OUTPUT IS DIRECTED TO A DISK FILE, BE SURE
 TO USE THE FORTRAN SWITCH WHEN TYPING IT ON THE TERMINAL OR THE
 LINE PRINTER.	THE PROGRAM PROMPTS FOR THE FOLLOWING ITEMS OF IN-
 FORMATION: 
 
 1. DATE
 2. TO
 3. FROM
 4. SUBJECT
 5. COPIES
 
 EACH REQUEST MAY BE SUPPLIED WITH A LITERAL AT THE TERMINAL.
 
 IF THE RESPONSE TO THE FIRST QUESTION IS A FILENAME OF THE FORM
 "@FILE.EXT" OR "^FILE.EXT" THE INPUT WILL START TO BE ACCEPTED
 FROM THAT FILE UNTIL ALL INPUTS THROUGH ITEM 4 ARE SATISFIED OR UN-
 TIL AN END OF FILE IS ENCOUNTERED AT WHICH TIME THE ITEM BEING INPUT
 WILL BE REQUESTED FROM THE TERMINAL.	HOWEVER, IF THE FIRST QUESTION
 IS ANSWERED WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN,	THE CURRENT DATE WILL BE
 USED AND WILL BE OF THE FORM DD-MMM-YY.
 
 THE SECOND AND THIRD QUESTIONS MAY BE ANSWERED IN SEVERAL WAYS.	THE
 SIMPLEST ANSWER WOULD BE A SINGLE NAME FOLLOWED BY A CARRIAGE RETURN.
 HOWEVER, IF YOU DESIRED TO SEND THE MEMO TO SEVERAL PERSONS OR FROM
 SEVERAL PERSONS YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS:
 
	OPTION 1: SEVERAL NAMES SEPARATED BY SLASHES (/)
	EX:	NAME 1/NAME 2/ NAME 3/ NAME 4/
		NAME 5/NAME 6/NAME 7
	OPTION 2: SEVERAL NAMES CONTAINED IN A FILE
		(THIS OPTION ONLY AVAILABLE ON TO: )
	EX:	@FILE.EXT	OR	^FILE.EXT
		WHERE THE FILE CONTAINS A LIST AS IN OPTION
		1 OR SEVERAL LINES WITH ONE NAME PER LINE
		FOLLOWED BY A CARRIAGE RETURN.
 
 THE PROGRAM WILL AUTOMATICALLY PUT THE WORD "DISTRIBUTION" IN FOR TO:
 OR COPIES: IF THE NUMBER OF NAMES EXCEEDS FIVE.	CONSEQUENTLY, AN ERR-
 OR CONDITION WILL ARISE IF BOTH THE TO: LIST AND THE COPIES: LIST CON-
 TAIN MORE THAN FIVE PERSONS.	THIS CONDITION WILL CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO
 PRINT AN ERROR MESSAGE AND ABORT.
 
 THE DISTRIBUTION LIST IN EITHER CASE WILL BE ATTACHED TO THE END OF
 THE MEMO.
 
 ITEM 5 MAY CONTAIN AS MANY SINGLE LINE ENTRIES AS DESIRED AND MAY
 BE TERMINATED WITH A CARRIAGE RETURN OR A "$" CARRIAGE RETURN.
 ITEM 5 MAY ALSO BE ANSWERED AT ANY TIME WITH THE NAME OF A FILE IN
 THE ABOVE MENTIONED FORMAT.
 
 THE PROGRAM WILL THEN REQUEST THE DESTINATION OF THE MEMO,
 I.E., THE FILENAME ON WHICH TO WRITE IT OR THE TERMINAL, AND
 THE FILENAME HOLDING THE CONTENTS OR BODY OF THE MEMO.
 
 ANY TIME A LINE CONSISTS OF ONLY A "$", A NEW PAGE WILL BE GENERATED.
 
 UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED, FILENAMES WILL BE ASSUMED TO HAVE
 THE EXTENSION ".DAT".
 
 ATTACHMENTS MAY BE INCLUDED WITH A MEMO BY USING THE COMMAND "ATTACH-
 MENT" AT THE COMMAND LEVEL(":").
 
 
 SUBJECTS MAY BE INPUT UP TO FIVE LINES LONG WITH UP TO 60 CHARACTERS
 PER LINE.	SUBJECT	CONTINUATION IS INDICATED BY ENDING EACH LINE
 WITH A SLASH (/) OR AN AMPER (&).

$CAP$
 THIS PROGRAM WILL GENERATE A FORMATTED MEMO.	PAGE NUMBERING IS AUTO-
 MATIC BUT MAY BE FORCED WHENEVER A NEW PAGE IS DESIRED.	THE BODY
 OR CONTENTS OF THE MEMO ARE NORMALLY PREPARED IN EDITOR AND MAY
 CONTAIN LOWER CASE CHARACTERS.	ALTHOUGH THE HEADINGS ARE NORMALLY EN-
 TERED CONVERSATIONALLY, THEY TOO MAY BE ENTERED FROM A FILE.
