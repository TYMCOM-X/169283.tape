1.  SUMMARY

THIS  RELEASE  CORRECTS  SEVERAL  OUTSTANDING  DEFICIENCIES,
INCLUDING  THE  FAILURE  TO LIST ALL ROUTINES WHICH MULTIPLY
SPECIFY A SYMBOL AND THE ABILITY TO HANDLE  INDEXED  LIBRARY
FILES.   IN ADDITION, THE COMMAND HANDLING HAS BEEN IMPROVED
TO INCLUDE DEFAULT DEVICE  DSK:,  DEFAULT  OUTPUT  EXTENSION
.GLB,  AND  TO  ACCEPT  PROJECT-PROGRAMMER NUMBERS AND INPUT
FILE EXTENSIONS.  SEVERAL ERROR MESSAGES HAVE BEEN IMPROVED,
AND  THE COMMAND CHARACTER HANDLING HAS BEEN STANDARDIZED TO
ACCEPT = AND  LOWER  CASE.   THE  CHANGES  ARE  ALL  UPWARDS
COMPATABLE FROM THE PREVIOUS VERSION.

THIS VERSION SUPERSEDES ALL PREVIOUS VERSIONS  AND  RUNS  ON
ALL  SUPPORTED  MONITORS.   IT  HAS  NO  KNOWN DEFICIENCIES.
SECTION 3 OF THIS FILE LISTS SEVERAL SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS.

GLOB IS DOCUMENTED IN SOFTWARE NOTEBOOK 1B.

2.  EXTERNAL CHANGES

2.1 DEFAULTS (SPR 10-3383)

THE INPUT FILES DEFAULT TO DSK:.REL[SELF].  THE OUTPUT FILES
DEFAULT  TO DSK:.GLB[SELF].  IF NO OUTPUT FILE IS SPECIFIED,
THE DEFAULT IS TTY:.GLB[SELF].  IF NO OUTPUT  FILE  NAME  IS
SPECIFIED, THE NAME OF THE LAST INPUT FILE IS USED.

2.2 DIRECTORIES

GLOB NOW  ACCEPTS  PROJECT-PROGRAMMER  NUMBERS  WITH  EITHER
INPUT   OR   OUTPUT   FILES  BY  ENCLOSING  THEM  IN  SQUARE
BRACKETS.(EG, [2,5]).

2.3 SWITCHES

THREE NEW SWITCHES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED:
/H INVOKES A HELP TEXT
/P ENABLES THE FEATURE DESCRIBED IN 2.4 (DEFAULT)
/Q DISABLES THE FEATURE.  (/P AND /Q SET AND  CLEAR  A  FLAG
WHICH DEFINES THE HANDLING OF ALL INPUT FILES UNTIL THE NEXT
OCCURANCE OF THE SWITCH OR UNTIL THE PROGRAM IS RESTARTED OR
REENTERRED.)

2.4 PRINTING OF MULTIPLY-SPECIFIED SYMBOLS (SPR 10-2652)

WHEN SEVERAL ROUTINES DEFINE  A  SYMBOL  TO  HAVE  THE  SAME
VALUE,  GLOB WILL NOW LIST ALL THE DEFINING ROUTINES AS WELL
AS THE USING  ROUTINES.   THE  FIRST  ROUTINE  DEFINING  THE
SYMBOL  WILL  BE LISTED AS THE DEFINER FOLLOWED BY A + SIGN.
EACH SUBSEQUENT DEFINER  WILL  BE  LISTED  AS  A  REFERENCER
PRECEEDED  BY  A  +  SIGN.   TO  SUPPRESS LISTING SUBSEQUENT
DEFINIERS, PRECEED THE APPROPRIATE INPUT FILE  SPECIFICATION
WITH A /Q SWITCH.

2.5 MISC.  CHANGES IN COMMAND SCANNER

GLOB NOW ACCEPTS LOWER CASE  ALPHABETICS  AS  EQUIVALENT  TO
UPPER  CASE.   IT ACCEPTS = AS EQUIVALENT TO _.  IN A FUTURE
RELEASE, THE COMMAND STRING WILL BE FURTHER STANDARDIZED  TO
USE  -  FOR  CONTINUATION AND TO TERMINATE ON THE FIRST LINE
FEED OR ESCAPE.  THEREFORE, BATCH JOBS SHOULD  BE  CODED  TO
USE ONE LINE AND TERMINATE WITH AN ESCAPE.  IF A ^C OF ^Z IS
INPUT, GLOB WILL EXIT TO THE MONITOR.

2.6 MISC.  CHANGES

THE OCTAL VALUE TYPEOUT IS SEPARATED INTO TWO  HALVES  BY  A
SPACE.   GLOB  NOW WILL HANDLE AN INDEXED LIBRARY FILE (SPRS
10-3401, 10-3656, AND 10-4533).  IT NO LONGER UNDER  CERTAIN
CONDITIONS  PRODUCES  A  DOUBLE  TYPEOUT.   IT  NOW  FITS 11
REFERENCES PER LINE RATHER THAN 9.  IT NOW BELIEVES THE NULL

GLOB.DOC--CHANGES FROM VERSION 4A TO 5              PAGE   3



INPUT EXTENSION IF THE PERIOD IS TYPED (SPR 10-2308).  

3.  KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

(SPRS 10-2542 AND 10-3774) SUGGESTION TO  ACCEPT  WILD-CARDS
(E.G., *.REL).

(SPRS 10-3568 AND 10-3774) SUGGESTION TO ACCEPT  A  STANDARD
COMMAND STRING (INCLUDING @).

4.  CHANGES IN INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

GLOB IS NOW A  SHARABLE  TWO-SEGMENT  PROGRAM.   WHEN  FIRST
INSTALLING  IT, DELETE SYS:GLOB.SAV.  SAVE GLOB WITH A SSAVE
COMMAND.  GLOB'S SOURCE IS NOW  ONE  FILE  GLOB.MAC,  RATHER
THAN CROSSX.MAC, CROSS.MAC, AND SCAN.MAC.

5.  INTERNAL CHANGES

IN MERGING THE SOURCE FILES INTO ONE, EXTENSIVE CHANGES WERE
MADE.   ALL  FLAG AND AC DEFINITIONS WERE MOVED TO THE FRONT
AND SORTED.  SEVERAL SYMBOLS WERE CHANGED TO AVOID  CONFLICT
OR  TO  CLEAN UP THE SOURCES.  THE TECO MACRO PGMFMT.TEC WAS
EXECUTED TO LINE UP THE COMMENTS AND  OPERANDS.   THE  ERROR
MESSAGE CODE WAS REVISED SLIGHTLY TO ENSURE CARRIAGE RETURNS
WHERE NEEDED.  THE OUTPUT TEXTS WERE CONVERTED TO UPPER  AND
LOWER  CASE.  CORE SIZE IS SHRUNK WHEN STARTING A NEW SET OF
FILES.  COMMENTS DESCRIBING THE INTERNAL TABLE FORMATS  WERE
INSERTED TO EASE FUTURE MAINTENANCE.
