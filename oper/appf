                              avoid the message in the future, the

The following table contains a summary of the diagnostic messages
that the system can issue.  The conventions used in the summary are:

   dev        represents any legal device name

   file.ext   represents any legal filename and filename extension

   adr        represents a user address

   n          represents a number, usually a job number or device
              unit number

   unit       represents any legal disk unit

Programs and commands causing the error message are given in
parentheses.

                    Monitor Diagnostic Messages


The typein is typed back      The monitor encountered an incorrect
preceded and followed by ?    character (e.g., a letter in a numeric
                              argument).  The incorrect char.
                              appears immediately before the 2nd ?

                              For example:     .CORE ABC
                                               ?CORE A?
-                                              ----------

                              An attempt was made to specify more units
                              to the active swapping list than the
                              monitor tables can handle.  Current
                              limit is 8. If the operator needs more
                              swapping space he should increase amounts
                              on the 8 units already specified.
                              (ONCE ONLY).

?ADDRESS CHECK FOR            The monitor checked a user address on a
DEVICE dev                    UUO and found it to bee too large 
                              ( C(JOBREL)) or too small ( JOBPFI); -
                              the address lies outside the bounds of
                              the user program.

?ALREADY ASSIGNED TO JOB n    The device is already assigned to
                              another user's job (job n).

?ARGS ARE: DAY, RUN, WAIT,    The user typed an illegal argument in
READ, WRITE                   the WATCH command string.

?BAD DIRECTORY FOR DEVICE     System cannot read or write DECtape 
DTAn                          directory without getting some kind of
                              error. This error often occurs when user
                              tries to write on a write-locked tape
                              or use a DECtape that has never been
                              written on.

BLOCK NOT FREE                M specifies a unit or file structure
                              logical block that is not free.

?BUSY                         The console addressed is not communicating
                              with the monitor. The operator's console
                              is never busy (SEND).

CANNOT EXCEED NO. BLOCKS      The number of disk blocks specified for
IN FILE STRUCTURE = m         reserved quotas or the no. of disk
                              blocks specified for the overdraw amount
                              was too large.  The operator should type
                              in a number less than or equal to m.
                              (ONCE ONLY).

CANNOT EXCEED NO. SAT         The number of SAT blocks in core cannot
BLOCKS ON UNIT = n            exceed the number of SAT blocks (n) on
                              the unit. The operator should type a
                              number less than or equal to n.
                              (ONCE ONLY).

?CAN'T ATT TO JOB             The project-programmer number specified
                              is not that of the owenr of the desired
                              job or is not (l,4).

?CAN'T CONTINUE               The job was terminated due to a monitor-
                              detected error and cannot be continued.

CAN'T CREATE NEW FILE         The monitor cannot create a new file
STRUCTURE SEARCH LIST         structure search list.

?CAN'T DECIPHER THAT          There is a syntax error in the command
                              string (MOUNT, DISMOUNT, FILE).

?CAN'T FIND FILE file.ext     The specified file could not be found.

?CAN'T DET DEV                The user is not logged-in under (l,4).

COMMAND ERROR                 General catch-all error response for
                              the COMPIL commands.  The syntax of the
                              command is in error, and the command
                              cannot be deciphered (COMPIL).


]CREATING NEW FILE1           The specified files does not exist;
                              therefore, a MAKE command is assumed.

dev: ASSIGNED                 The device has been successfully 
                              assigned to the user's job.

?DEVICE CAN'T BE REASSIGNED   A user's teletype cannot be reassigned,
                              or an attempt was made to reassign a
                              device that a job is still using.

?DEVICE dev OK?               The device is temporarily disabled.
                              The line printer may be turned off or
                              out of paper.  For magnetic tapes,
                              no tape is mounted or the switch is in
                              LOCAL. The user should correct the sit-
                              uation and then proceed (retry the
                              operation) by typing CONTINUE.

?dev WASN'T ASSIGNED          The device is not currently assigned
                              to the user's job and cannot be de-
                              assigned or reassigned by the job.

?DEVICE dev NOT AVAILABLE     Specified device cannot be initialized
                              because another user using it (COMPIL).

DISMOUNT COMPLETE             The DISMOUNT command has completed.

DPAn NOT AVAILABLE            The drive indicated by the user is not
                              currently available. (MOUNT).

DPAn NOT READY                The indicated drive is either off-
                              line or physically write-locked when
                              write-enabled was requested.  The
                              operator will be notified. (MOUNT)

DPA IS OFF-LINE               Controller DPA(RPl0) is off-line.  The
DO YOU WANT IT TO BE          operator should check settings of all
l) ON-LINE OR 2) DOWN?        switches in RPl0 bay.  All switches
(TYPE NO.)                    should be down.  After changing switches
                              operator should type l.  If operator does
                              not want monitor to use controller, he
                              should type 2. Also applies to DPB.
                              (ONCE ONLY).

DPA0 IS OFF-LINE              Operator should check START/STOP
DO YOU WANT IT TO BE          rocker switch and ENABLE/DISABLE 
1) ON-LINE, 2) OFF-LINE,      switch on the individual disk pack
OR 3) DOWN? (TYPE NO.)        unit. They should be in the normal
                              position with top of switch in. After
                              changing switches, operator should 
                              type l. If operator does not want
                              monitor to use unit, he should type 2.
                              This message also applies to DPAl,
                              DPA2,...,DPA7, DPB0, DPBl,...,DPB7.
                              (ONCE ONLY).

DPA0 IS WRITE PROTECTED.      Disk pack unit DPA0 is on-line, but
DO YOU WANT IT TO BE          is write-protected. If operator wishes
l) WRITE-ENABLED, OR          it to remain this way, he should type 2.
2) WRITE-PROTECTED?           Otherwise he should set the READWRITE/
                              READ ONLY rocker switch to normal (top
                              of switch in) and then type l.  This
                              message also applies with DPAl,...
                              DPA7, DPB0, DPBl,...,DPB7. (ONCE ONLY).

?ENTER FAILURE                The ENTER to write the file failed.
                              The error code may be seen by
                              examining location l.

?ERROR IN JOB n               A fatal error occurred in job or in
                              the monitor while servicing the job.
                              This typeout usually precedes a one-
                              line description of the error.

?EXCEED LOG-OUT m QUOTA       Total number of blocks for all the
BY n BLOCKS                   user's files exceeds the maximum
                              permitted value (m) by the
                              indicated amount n.  User may use PIP
                              or the DELETE command to remove files.
                              Until the user is under the limit, he
                              cannot dismount the file structure.

EXECUTION DELETED             A program is prevented from being 
                              executed because of errors detected
                              during assembly, compilation or
                              loading. Loading is performed, but the
                              loader exits to the monitor without
                              starting execution. (LOADER).

FHA IS OFF-LINE               Controller FHA (RCl0) is off-line.
DO YOU WANT IT TO BE          Operator should check settings of all
l) ON-LINE OR 2) DOWN?        switches in RV-l0 bay. All switches
(TYPE NO.)                    should be down. After changing switches,
                              operator should type l. If operator 
                              does not want monitor to use controller,
                              he should type 2. Also applies to FHB.
                              (ONCE ONLY).

FHA0 IS OFF-LINE              Operator should check unit dial selectors.
DO YOU WANT IT TO BE          One of them (DISK A, DISK B, DISK C, or
l) ON-LINE, 2) OFF-LINE,      DISK D) should be set to 0. Operator
OR 3) DOWN? (TYPE NO.)        should set the switches for all units
                              he has to 0, l, 2, 3.  The other units
                              should be OFF.  Operator should
                              not touch any dials which are dialed to
                              numbers numerically less than the one
                              just typed out, since monitor has
                              already read these units.  After
                              changing the switches and dials, the
                              operator should type l. If the unit is
                              temporarily down and will be fixed while
                              the system runs, he should type 2.  In
                              all other cases, he should type 3. 
                              Could apply to FHAl,...,FHA3, FHB0,...,
                              FHB3. (ONCE ONLY).

file.ext FOUND BAD BY         The file in the file structure has an

?FILENAME ALREADY IN USE      Specified files already exists (COMPIL).

FIRST BAT BLOCK CONSISTENCY   The ONCE ONLY dialog has discovered       
ERROR                         that the first of two redundant BAT
                              blocks does not contain some of the
                              data normally expected in a BAT block.
                              This is not a fatal error since the
                              other BAT block is probably all right.
                              If both BAT blocks have this error,
                              operator should initialize the BAT
                              blocks. This error may occur if some
                              of the diagnostics are run. (ONCE ONLY).

FIRST BAT BLOCK HARDWARE      The ONCE ONLY dialog has had a hardware
ERROR                         error while reading the first of two
                              redundant BAT blocks. Since there is
                              another BAT block, this error is usually
                              not fatal. The controller status is put
                              in the console lights (ONCE ONLY).

FIRST HOM BLOCK CONSISTENCY   The ONCE ONLY dialog has discovered
ERROR                         that the first of two redundant HOM
                              blocks does not contain some of the
                              data normally expected in a HOM block.
                              Therefore, none of the data should be
                              considered valid.  This is not a
                              serious error since the other HOM block
                              is usually all right. If both HOM blocks
                              have consistency errors, the operator
                              has to dissolve the file structures,
                              redefine, and refresh (ONCE ONLY).

FIRST HOM BLOCK HARDWARE      The ONCE ONLY dialog has had a
ERROR                         hardware error while reading or
                              writing the first of two redundant
                              HOM blocks. This is not fatal since
                              there is another HOM block. The
                              controller status is put in the
                              console lights, and controller is
                              left in its error condition (ONCE ONLY).

                              left in its error conditon (ONCE ONLY).

?SINGLE-ACCESS BY JOB n       The file structure is already single
                              access by indicated user.  (MOUNT).

STRUCTURE ALREADY MOUNTED     The requested file structure is already
                              mounted, but may not be in a readied 
                              state.  (MOUNT).

?STRUCTURE NOT IN             The file structure name does not exist in
STRLST.SYS                    the system administrator's file SYS:
                              STRLST.SYS, and therefore is not defined
                              for the system. The operator or adminis-
                              trator may be requested to define the file
                              structure by adding it to STRLST.SYS
                              with the REACT CUSP. (MOUNT).

?SWAP READ ERROR              A consistent checksum error has been
                              encountered when checksumming locastions
                              JOBDAC through JOBDAC+74 of the job data
                              area during swapping.

?SYNTAX ERROR                 There is a syntax error in command string.

?SYSTEM ERROR - xxxxxx        System errors designate operator or 
                              system errors and are not a direct
                              fault of the user.  They are typed for
                              possible diagnostic use.

?TOO FEW ARGUMENTS            A command has been typed, but necessary
                              arguments are missing.

TOO MANY FILE STRUCTURES      The number of file structures exceeds
                              the capacity of the monitor data base.
                              Current limit is 14   . (ONCE ONLY).
                                                 l0

TOO MANY NAMES or TOO         Command string complexity exceeds table
MANY SWITCHES                 space in the COMPIL CUSP (COMPIL).

TOO SMALL - MIN.              An answer to the ONCE ONLY dialog or
NO. = X                       a default value is too small. Type in
                              an answer greater than or equal to X.

?TRANSMISSION ERROR           During a SAVE, GET, or RUN command, system
                              received parity errors from device, or was
                              unable to read user's file in some other
                              way. This can be as simple as trying to
                              write on a write-locked tape.

?TRY LARGER ARG               The specified argument is too small
                              for the program.

?TTYn ALREADY ATTACHED        Job number is erroneous and is attached
                              to another console, or another user is
                              attached to the job.

TWO LOGICAL UNIT n's          The active swapping list has more than
FOUND IN ACTIVE SWAPPING      one unit in the same position. The
LIST                          operator must redefine the active swapping
                              list. (ONCE ONLY).

TWO LOGICAL UNIT n's          Two units are marked to be in the same
FOUND IN STR DSKn             logical position in file structure. This
                              happens only if two different file struc-
                              tures have been given same name. Operator
                              should try to remove pack that does not
                              belong and then restart monitor at l40.
                              Otherwise, he has to dissolve DSKn,
                            redefine it and refresh it (ONCE ONLY).

TWO LOGICAL STR n's           Two file structures are marked to be in
FOUND IN "SYS" SEARCH         the same position in the SYS search list.
LIST                          Operator should change the SYS search list
                              when asked. Refreshing is not required.
                              (ONCE ONLY).

UFD QUOTAS CHANGED,           Block quotas on this file structure as
RESERVED (n) F.C.F.S.(n)      established by QUOTA.SYS have changed
LOGGED-OUT (n)                since the user's last use of file structure.
                              The user's UFD will be changed to specify
                              the indicated quotas. (MOUNT).

?UNDEFINED SWITCH switch      The specified switch is either undefined 
                              or not unique (MOUNT, DISMOUNT).

unit                          Operator should answer with N or a CR
NO. BAD REGIONS = m           to leave BAT blocks alone on this unit.
NO. BAD BLOCKS = n            The only time the operator should initialize
DO YOU WANT TO INITIALIZE     is the first time the disk is written,
THE BAD BLOCKS ON THIS        since the blocks contain accumulated
UNIT?                         information about bad sectors. If the
                              operator answers Y, the ONCE ONLY dialog
                              responds with NOT NORMALLY DONE, ARE YOU
                              SURE?  Answer Y only if this important
                              data is to be erased. (ONCE ONLY).

UNIT ALREADY IN ACTIVE        An attempt was made to specify a unit to
SWAPPING LIST                 be in the active swapping list more than
                              once. The operator should type a different
                              unit name to be in the active swapping
                              list. If the operator has included the
                              unit name earlier by mistake, he will have
                              another chance to change the active 
                              swapping list (ONCE ONLY).

UNIT ALREADY IN FILE          An attempt was made to specify a unit to
STRUCTURE                     be in more than one file structure. The
                              operator should type a different unit name
                              to be in this file structure. If operator
                              has included the unit in an earlier file
                              structure by mistake, he will have to
                              dissolve it. (ONCE ONLY).

UNIT id ALREADY MOUNTED       File structure is already mounted but
ON DRIVE DPAn                 is on different drives than user
                              specified. (MOUNT).

UNIT HAS NO SPACE             An attempt has been made to specify a
ALLOCATED FOR SWAPPING        unit which has no swapping space
                              allocated to be part of the active
                              swapping list. The unit is not added to
                              the list. The operator should do one of
                              the following:

                              l) Specify another unit,
                              2) Type an extra CR signifying    
                                 completion,
                              3) Define swapping space for a unit
                                 not in a file structure,
                              4) Change swapping space for a unit in
                                 a file structure and refresh it.
                                 (ONCE ONLY).

UNRECOGNIZABLE SWITCH         An ambiguous or undefined word has been
                              preceded by a slash. (COMPIL).

?UUO AT USER adr              This message accompanies many error
                              messages and indicates location of UUO 
                              that was the last instruction the user
                              program executed before error occurred.

WAITING....                   A request has been queued to operator and
                              the command is waiting for completion of
                              necessary action. If user does not want to
                              wait for confirmation, he may type
                              control-C. (MOUNT, DISMOUNT).

?WASN'T DET                   Specified device is not detached.

X                             If the system is fully loaded any user
                              (after lst user) who attempts to LOGIN
                              receives this character in response
                              to any character typed (LOGIN).

?l+lnK CORE                   The swapping space or core allocated to
VIR. CORE LEFT = 0            timesharing is all in use (i.e., there is
                              no available virtual core).
