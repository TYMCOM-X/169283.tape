REGARDING: Telecopy for 940/PDP10

     As TYMNET grows, the providing of Inter-machine File transfer
capability is becoming increasingly important.  Any extra time required
for more comprehensive and general solutions to the problems involved
are sure to be justified by their current and future usefulness.

     There are currently two major software entities that can provide
assistance in transferring files between 940's and PDP10's.  One is
the program NET currently installed in the TYMSHARE library which allows
files to be telecopied from one PDP10 to another PDP10 thru a 940
"middleman".  It has a proven user interface with syntax convenient
to accomplishing Inter-machine File transfer.  The Accounting Network
Project which will provide general Inter-machine data manipulation for
Project MAC is the other.  This "ACNET" software has been designed with
a very general and comprehensive approach and has many advantages in 
the area of actual data transfer.

     The most useful package would incorporate the user interface from
"NET" and the data transfer modules from "ACNET" (both written in SIMPL)
and enough new logic to deal with the following problems.

     How a symbolic file is stored varies widely from system to
system.  In the PDP10-TYMCOM X/940-TYMCOM IX case,
  1) different character sets are used
  2) tabs are stored as 1 character or a certain number of blanks
  3) a special multi-blank character followed by a count is used for
      blank compression only on TYMCOM IX
  4) TYMCOM IX has special characters for carriage return/line feed
      and line feed/carriage return combinations
  5) TYMCOM X has an extra bit used for special line numbers
  6) form feed has different meanings

     It has been proposed that an "INTER-MACHINE STANDARD" be estab-
lished having a given character set (such as (ASCII)X3.4-1968),
specifying which storing conventions, and probably include provisions
for a variable length trailer containing control information.
ie. 1) number of bits in the file
    2) tab settings (if any)
    3) check summing method and checksum
    4) license file should be given

     If such a standard did exist, each new machine/operating system
would need only two conversion routines.  One converting
to and one from the INTER-MACHINE STANDARD.  The package that telecopies
files between 940's and PDP10's should contain the first such
routines.  This will pave the way to a quick solution of the impending
370/940/PDP10 transfer problems.

     As a very approximate time frame:
  1) 1 week for specifying INTER-MACHINE STANDARD
  2) 1 week for each of the conversion routines
  3) 2 weeks to extract and adjust the user interface from NET
  4) 2 weeks to select and incorporate the ACNET modules
  5) 2 weeks for final debugging
This is a total of 8 man-weeks that should be increased to 10 for
unexpected problems.
