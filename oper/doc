                GENERAL INFORMATION

        THIS SPECIFICATION WILL DESCRIBE THE LIBRARY MAINTENANCE
ROUTINE FOR THE TYCOM X SYSTEM. THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THIS PROGRAM
WILL BE TO AID IN MAINTAINING AN UP-TO-DATE LIBRARY
ON ALL TYMCOM X SYSTEMS. THERE WILL BE A MASTER FILE ON EACH SYSTEM
WHICH WILL BE USED FOR UPDATING PURPOSES ON THAT SYSTEM. THE
PROGRAM WILL ONLY BE  ACCESSIBLE BY THOSE USERS HAVING OPERATOR
LICENSE.


                COMMAND STRUCTURE

        THE SYSTEM WILL CONSIST OF A SET OF COMMANDS WHICH CAN
BE USED TO INTERROGATE THE MASTER FILE AND THE LIBRARY. THESE
COMMANDS MAY BE USED TO  VERIFY THAT EACH FILE ON THE LIBRARY
IS DEFINED CORRECTLY AND HAS THE CORRECT VERSION.
ALL COMMANDS MAY BE ABBREVIATED TO THREE
CHARACTERS. EACH COMMAND MUST BE TERMINATED BY A CARRIAGE RETURN.


COMMAND         DESCRIPTION

MODE:           THIS COMMAND IS USED TO SET THE MODE OF OPERATION
                FOR ALL OTHER COMMANDS IN THE PROGRAM.
                IT IS USED TO SPECIFY WHICH DATA FIELD IN THE MASTER
                FILE THAT EACH COMMAND IS TO CONCERN ITSELF WITH.
                THE NORMAL MODE FOR THE PROGRAM WILL BE SINGLE FILES,
                CHECKSUM,LICENSE, AND PROTECTION. VALID MODES ARE:


   MODE         DESCRIPTION

   ALL          THIS MODE INFORMS THE PROGRAM TO PROCESS ALL FILES
                LOCATED IN THE MASTER FILE. IT IS ONLY USED WITH
                THE VERIFY AND THE LIST COMMAND.

   CHECKSUM     THIS MODE INFORMS THE PROGRAM TO LOOK AT THE CHECKSUM
                FIELD IN THE MASTER FILE OF THE SYSTEM WHERE THE PROGRAM
                IS BEING EXECUTED. THIS MODE IS USED WITH THE
                VERIFY, LIST AND CHANGE COMMANDS.

   QUALITY      IF THIS MODE IS SET, THE QUALITY ASSUANCE PERSON 
                RESPONSIBLE FOR INSTALING NEW VERSIONS AND VERIFYING
                BUG REPORTS  WILL BE LISTED DURING THE LIST COMMAND.
                THE QUALITY ASSURANCE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR A PROGRAM
                MAY BE MODIFIED DURING THE CHANGE COMMAND IF THIS MODE
                IS SET.

   SOFTWARE     THIS MODE ALLOWS THE PROGRAMMER FIELD TO BE PRINTED
                DURING THE LIST COMMAND. IT ALSO ALLOWS THE PROGRAMMER
                FIELD TO BE MODIFIED DURING THE CHANGE COMMAND.

   FIELD        THIS MODE CAUSES THE LIST COMMAND TO PRINT TO THE
                OUTPUT FILE A LIST OF RELEASE DATES IF THE FILE
                ON THE LIBRARY IS IN A FIELD TEST.

   CREATION     THIS CAUSES THE LIST COMMAND TO LIST THE CREATION
                DATE OF ANY FILE ENTERED. THIS MODE WILL
                ALSO CAUSE THE CHANGE COMMAND TO READ THE CREATION
                DATE OF THE FILE ON THE LIBRARY AND ENTER IT INTO
                THE MASTER FILE, IF THE PROGRAM IS BEING EXECUTED ON
                THE PRIME SYSTEM FOR THE FILE ENTERED.

   PROTECT      THIS MODE CAUSES THE LIST COMMAND TO LIST THE
                PROTECTION OF THE FILE TO THE OUTPUT FILE. IF
                THIS MODE IS SET, THE VERIFY COMMAND WILL VERIFY 
                THAT THE FILE ON THE LIBRARY HAS THE CORRECT 
                PROTECTION, AS SPECIFIED BY THE MASTER FILE. THIS MODE
                WILL CAUES THE CHANGE COMMAND TO ENTER THE PROTECTION OF
                THE FILE ON THE LIBRARY INTO THE MASTER FILE.

   SYS          THIS MODE IS ONLY USED WITH THE VERIFY COMMAND. IT 
                CAUSES THE VERIFY COMMAND TO VERIFY THAT ALL FILES
                IN THE LIBRARY ARE IN THE MASTER DATA FILE.

   SINGLE       THIS MODE IS  USED TO INFORM THE PROGRAM THAT THE USER
                ONLY WANTS TO DEAL WITH SINGLE FILES, INSTEAD OF ALL
                FILES IN THE MASTER DATA FILE.

   LICENSE      THIS MODE IS USED WITH THE VERIFY,ADD,LIST, AND CHANGE 
                COMMANDS. IN THE VERIFY COMMAND IT CAUSES  THE LICENSE
                OF THE FILE TO BE COMPARED WITH THAT STORED IN THE MASTER
                FILE. DURING THE ADD COMMAND, THE LICENSE OF THE FILE
                ON THE LIBRARY IS ADDED TO THE MASTER FILE. IF THIS MODE
                IS SET WHEN THE LIST COMMAND IS ISSUED, THE LICENSE OF
                THE FILE THAT IS STORED ON THE MASTER FILE WILL BE 
                LISTED.

VERIFY:         THIS COMMAND IS USED  TO VERIFY INFORMATION THAT IS ON
                THE MASTER FILE. IT WILL ONLY VERIFY ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN
                SET BY THE MODE COMMAND. IF SYS MODE IS SET, IT WILL
                CHECK TO SEE IF ALL FILES IN THE LIBRARY
                HAVE ENTRIES IN THE MASTER FILE.

ADD:            THIS COMMAND IS USED TO ADD NEW PROGRAMS TO THE
                MASTER FILE. WHEN THE ADD COMMAND IS ISSUED, THE FILE
                MUST ALREADY HAVE BEEN SET UP IN THE LIBRARY.
                THE FILE MUST BE SETUP AND DEFINED CORRECTLY, BECAUSE
                THE PROGRAM WILL TAKE THE LICENSE AND PROTECTION
                DIRECTLY OFF OF THE LIBRARY FILE FOR THE MASTER FILE.
                ANY INFORMATION THAT IS NOT AVAILIBLE FROM
                THE LIBRARY FILE MUST BE ENTERED FROM THE TERMINAL.

FIELD:          THIS COMMAND IS USED TO ENTER A PROGRAM INTO FIELD TEST.
                IT WILL TAKE ALL INFORMATION FROM THE LIBRARY AND
                ENTER IT INTO THE MASTER FILE. INFORMATION NOT AVAILIBLE
                FROM THE LIBRARY MUST BE ENTERED FROM THE TERMINAL.

DELETE:         THIS COMMAND IS USED TO DELETE A FILE FROM THE MASTER
                FILE. THE FILE MUST ALREADY BE DELETED FROM THE LIBRARY
                AT THE TIME THIS COMMAND IS ISSUED. IF THE FILE HAS
                NOT BEEN DELETED FROM THE LIBRARY, NO ACTION WILL
                BE TAKEN.

LIST:           THIS COMMAND LISTS ALL DATA FIELDS IN THE MASTER FILE
                THAT HAVE BEEN SPECIFIED BY THE MODE COMMAND TO THE
                OUTPUT FILE.

CHANGE:         THIS COMMAND ALLOWS THE USER TO UPDATE INFORMATION ABOUT
                A FILE THAT IS ON THE LIBRARY. ALL INFORMATION IS TAKEN
                DIRECTLY FROM THE LIBRARY FILE, IF IT IS
                AVAILIBLE. ANY INFORMATION THAT IS NOT AVAILIBLE ON THE
                LIBRARY MUST BE ENTERED FROM THE TERMINAL. THE ONLY
                INFORMATION FIELDS THAT ARE CHANGED ARE THOSE SET BY
                THE MODE COMMAND.

PPN:            THIS COMMAND WILL PRINT THE PROJECT PROGRAMMER NUMBER
                OF THE LAST PERSON TO WRITE ON THE FILE.
                IT WILL ALSO PRINT THE CREATION DATE
                OF THE FILE AND THE USER NAME OF THE PROJECT PROGRAMMER
                IF IT IS A VALID USER ON THAT SYSTEM.

UPDATE:         THIS COMMAND IS USED TO CREATE A NEW MASTER FILE
                FROM THE MASTER FILES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL SYSTEM.

QUIT:           THIS COMMAND WILL RETURN THE USER TO THE EXECUTIVE.

EXIT:           THIS COMMAND WILL RETURN THE USER TO THE EXECUTIVE.

HELP:           THIS COMMAND WILL LIST ALL VALID COMMANDS IN
                THE PROGRAM.



                DATA BASE



        THE DATA BASE WILL CONSIST OF A RECORD FOR EACH FILE ON 
THE LIBRARY. THE RECORD WILL CONSIST OF SIXTEEN WORDS. INITIALLY
ALL SIXTEEN WORDS WILL NOT BE USED. EACH RECORD WILL BE DEFINED AS
FOLLOWS.
