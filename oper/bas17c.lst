5.0 INTERNAL CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM

     Version 17C includes all published patches for previous
     versions, and patches to fix all bugs reported in SPR's
     up through and including SPR  10-9308.   There  are  no
     SPR's  outstanding.   The  list  of  bugs fixed between
     Version 17B and Version 17C is in Appendix  A  of  this
     memo.

     The entry points now contain JRST 1,  instructions,  so
     that  BASIC  can  be  set  to execute only on the KI-10
     (Edit no.  130).

APPENDIX A -- BUGS FIXED IN VERSION 17C

     Version 17C includes all of the published  patches  for
     Version  17B  and  answers  to  all  SPR's  up  to  and
     including SPR 10-9308.

     This Appendix lists all of the  bugs  which  have  been
     fixed and also all of the edits which have been made.


     1.  The core manager sometimes garbles string variables
     during  core  expansion.   (SPR  10-8125).   (Edit  no.
     117).

     2.  When more core is needed at execution  time,  BASIC
     is  usually supposed to pack down the strings currently
     in core to see if it can obtain the needed room without
     asking  the  monitor  for  core.  However, sometimes it
     fails to pack and simply requests core.  This  is  most
     likely  to  occur  in a program which handles many null
     strings.   It  results  in  the   program's   executing
     correctly,  but  using much too much core.  (No SPR was
     submitted.).  (Edit no.  120).

     3.  QUEUE sometimes returns  the  "?  FILE  NOT  FOUND"
     message  for a file which actually exists.  (No SPR was
     submitted.).  (Edit no.  120).

     4.  PRINT USING statements loop when  asked  to  output
     null strings.  (SPR 10-8365).  (Edit no.  121).

     5.  A program which has nine files open  simu;taneously
     sometimes  dies  in  an  Address  Check.   (No  SPR was
     submitted.).  (Edit no.  122).

     6.  Sometimes when BASIC runs out of core it  does  not
     output  its  usual  "? OUT OF ROOM" message, but rather
     dies in an Address Check.  (SPR  10-8648).   (Edit  no.
     123)

     7.  Unquoted filenames which begin with a  digit  cause
     various  problems  with  the  CHAIN  statement (Ill mem
     refs, etc.).  (SPR 10-8634).  (Edit no.  124).

     8.  Assigning a null string from a list or table to any
     string  variable  by means of a LET statement causes an
     Ill Mem Ref or other problems.  (SPR  10-8839).   (Edit
     no.  125.).

     9.  The random number generator does not work  properly
     when  BASIC  is  run  on  the  KI-10--it  results in an
     Address Check, either during the current  execution  of
     the RUN(NH) command or during a subsequent execution of

BASIC.DOC -- APPENDIX A -- Bugs Fixed in Version 17CPAGE   4
Version 17C


     it.  (SPR 10-8757).  (Edit no.  126).

     10.  The COPY command does not detect a syntax error in
     the  command  if the initial part of the command (up to
     the error)  satisfies  its  syntax  requirements.   For
     example,  COPY  NONAME  >  TTY*TEST4  where  * had been
     mistyped for : would result in the creation of the file
     DSK:TTY.BAS  and  no  error message instead of the file
     TTY:TEST4.BAS.  (No SPR  was  submitted.).   (Edit  no.
     127).

     11.  For edit no.  130, see Section 5.0 of this memo.

1.0 SUMMARY


     1.1 This release contains various bug fixes and  a  few
     minor  improvements;  it includes all published patches
     for V.17A and patches to fix all bugs reported in SPR's
     up to and including SPR 10-7755.

     1.2 BASIC V.17B runs  on  all  supported  monitors  and
     fully supersedes all previous versions.  The only known
     deficiency is that the intrinsic  functions  COS,  COT,
     and  TAN are sometimes only accurate to four digits for
     arguments near integral multiples of PI/2.

     1.4 Incompatabilities between V.17A and V.17B
     Under the 5.04 and later monitors, and  providing  that
     BASIC  is  not  running  under  MPB, BASIC now traps on
     control C and does a REENTER.  There is a new  command,
     MONITOR, (described in Section 2.1 of this memo), which
     is equivalent to control C, so that the user can  still
     reach monitor level to assign devices, etc.  Of course,
     the old commands SYSTEM(EXIT) and BYE(LOGOUT) are still
     available  as  well.  Note that control Cing out of the
     execution of a RUN(NH) command  will  cause  any  files
     open  in the program being executed to be closed during
     the REENter process.  Under the  present  monitors  the
     user  may  sometimes  still  get  to  monitor level via
     control C if he or she types more control Cs  than  are
     necessary to interrupt; this is a monitor problem which
     may be fixed in the 5.04B and 5.05 monitors.

2.0 EXTERNAL CHANGES

     2.1 New Features in Version 17B.

        1.  The initial message  "NEW  OR  OLD--"  has  been
        replaced  by  "READY, FOR HELP TYPE HELP.".  The new
        HELP command results in the output of a file of help
        text onto the user's terminal.  Any characters after
        the initial three non-blank, non-tab  characters  in
        the  command  are  ignored.   It  is  expected  that
        additional help  files  will  be  available  in  the
        future,  at  which  time  the  HELP  command will be
        expanded.

        2.  Under the 5.04 and later monitors, and providing
        that BASIC is not running under MPB, BASIC now traps
        on control C and does a REENTER.  If the user wishes
        to  temporarily leave BASIC to assign devices, etc.,
        he can do so by means of the  new  command  MONITOR.
        MONITOR  is equivalent to control C.  Of course, the
        old commands SYSTEM(EXIT), and BYE(LOGOUT) are  also
        available.   Note  that  control  Cing  out  of  the
        execution of a RUN(NH) command will cause any  files
        open  in  the  program  being  executed to be closed
        during  the  REENter  process.   Under  the  present
        monitors the user may sometimes still get to monitor
        level via control C if he or she types more  control
        Cs  than  are  necessary  to  interrupt;  this  is a
        monitor problem which may be fixed in the 5.04B  and
        5.05 monitors.

        3.  There is a new intrinsic numeric  function  TIM.
        TIM  accepts  no  arguments.  It returns the elapsed
        execution time,  in  seconds,  since  the  start  of
        execution  of  the  program.   Note that it does not
        include the compile and load time.  (If programs are
        CHAINed  together, then TIM returns the elapsed time
        since the start of execution of the first program in
        the  chain, and the compile and load times for every
        program after the first are included in it.).

        4.  Wherever BASIC accepts an argument of the  forms
        dev:  or  dev:filenm.ext,  it will now accept *** or
        filenm.ext***, respectively, to  indicate  that  the
        requested  device is BAS.  BAS may also be specified
        in the usual  manner  in  the  device  part  of  the
        specification,  as  BAS:TEST.4, for example.  In the
        5.05 and later monitors, BAS has been established as
        area  [5,1].   BASIC  tests for the existence of BAS
        and if BAS is not found BASIC will assume DSK:[5,1].

Version 17B


        5.  DIM statements will now accept either  the  word
        DIM or the word DIMENSION.

        6.  NEXT statements may now be stacked.  That is,

                    NEXT A,B,C

        is equivalent to 

                    NEXT A
                    NEXT B
                    NEXT C

        Note that the order of the arguments is important.




     2.2 Bugs Fixed in Version 17B
     The bugs fixed between Version 17A and Version 17B  are
     listed in Appendix A of this memo.


     2.3 Documentation Changes
     The corrections to the  BASIC  Conversational  Language
     Manual  which  is  in  Notebook  #3 of the DECsystem-10
     Software Notebooks are listed in Section  3.2  of  this
     memo.

3.0 KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

     3.1 Known Bugs
     The intrinsic functions COS, TAN, and COT are sometimes
     only  accurate  to 4 digits for arguments near integral
     multiples of PI/2.

     3.2 Known Documentation Deficiencies
     The   following   are   corrections   to   the    BASIC
     Conversational  Language  Manual  in Notebook #3 of the
     DECsystem-10 Software Notebooks, as it exists as of the
     June   1972   updates.    These   corrections  will  be
     incorporated in a future update to the Manual.


          1.  The following execution error message has been
          added   to  Appendix  B,  BASIC  Diagnostic  Error
          Messages:

               % MAGNITUDE OF SIN OR COS ARG TOO LARGE TO
                  BE SIGNIFICANT IN LINE nn

          2.  The following compilation error message, added
          in V.17A, has been removed from V.17B and does not
          appear in the manual, because  channel  specifiers
          are  now  handled  by  the general formula routine
          (see the description of patch #7 in Appendix A  of
          this memo):

               ? CHANNEL SPECIFIER NOT IN CORRECT FORM
                  IN LINE nn

             The following compilation  error  messages  are
             new:

               ? ILLEGAL FORMAT WHERE THE WORDS THEN
                  OR GO TO WERE EXPECTED IN LINE nn

               ? INITIAL PART OF STATEMENT NEITHER MATCHES
                  A STATEMENT KEYWORD NOR HAS A FORM LEGAL
                  FOR AN IMPLIED LET--CHECK FOR MISSPELLING
                  IN LINE nn

             In addition, there are  new  compilation  error
             messages of the form:

               ? &1 WAS SEEN WHERE &2 WAS EXPECTED
                  IN LINE nn

             where &1 and &2 are appropriate  characters  or
             phrases.  For example:

BASIC.DOC -- Known Bugs and Deficiencies            PAGE   9
Version 17B


               ? ( WAS SEEN WHERE # OR : WAS EXPECTED
                  IN LINE nn


          3.  In quote mode it is  not  legal  to  output  a
          double  quote character in a string; an attempt to
          do so will result in a fatal error message  (BASIC
          itself  writes  the  double quote characters which
          enclose the string.).

          4.  See also the new features described in Section
          2.1 of this memo.




4.0 CHANGES IN INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

     The installation instructions have changed; see the MPB
     file BASIC.CTL for details.


5.0 INTERNAL CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM

     Version 17B includes all published patches for previous
     versions, and patches to fix all bugs reported in SPR's
     up through and including SPR  10-7755.   There  are  no
     SPR's  outstanding.   The  list  of  bugs fixed between
     Version 17A and Version 17B is in Appendix A.  The high
     segment size has increased by 1K to 13K.

BASIC.DOC -- APPENDIX A -- Bugs Fixed in Version 17BPAGE  10
Version 17B


APPENDIX A -- BUGS FIXED IN VERSION 17B

     Version 17B includes all of the published  patches  for
     Version  17A  and  answers  to  all  SPR's  up  to  and
     including SPR 10-7755.

     1.   Whenever  BASIC  wrote  out  a  file  it  set  the
     protection to the installation standard protection plus
     the "don't delete"  bit.   Now,  if  the  file  already
     exists,  its  protection  is  unchanged except that the
     don't delete bit is ored in if the first field  in  the
     code is less than 1.  (SPR 10-7289).

     2.   AC's  which  could  be   destroyed   by   priority
     interrupts were not saved.  (No SPR was submitted.)

     3.  In a random access numeric file, writing  a  record
     which  was after the last record in the file but within
     the last block of the file  usually  resulted  in  that
     block  being  zeroed  before  that  record was written,
     unless the last block was the block currently  in  use.
     (SPR 10-6984).

     4.  The backarrow character was treated like rubout  on
     input.  (SPR 10-6762).

     5.  The simple PRINT statement sometimes output numbers
     with  correct  values  but  with  incorrect  forms; for
     example, 0.000000810685 instead  of  8.10685E-7.   (SPR
     10-6534).

     6.  A warning error message and an answer of 0 are  now
     returned  when  SIN/COS receive arguments which are too
     large to be significant.  (SPR 10-6235).

     7.  Numeric expressions are  now  allowed  for  channel
     specifiers; for example:

                 PRINT #T-1, SQRT(A)

     (SPR 10-4883).

     8.   The  intrinsic  function  name   LOG10   was   not
     recognized  by  the compiler; an error message resulted
     for statements which contained LOG10.   (The  alternate
     name   CLOG   was   handled   properly.)  (No  SPR  was
     submitted.).


BASIC.DOC -- APPENDIX A -- Bugs Fixed in Version 17BPAGE  11
Version 17B


     9.  Previous to Version 17B, the  core  manager  always
     grabbed  core  in  1K  increments;  in Version 17B, the
     execution time of programs which  do  extensive  string
     handling   has   been  improved  by  setting  the  core
     increment size to 1, 2, or 3K, depending on the  number
     of strings in the program.  (No SPR was submitted.).

     10.   MAT  READ,  IDN,  CON,  and  ZER  now   interpret
     redimensioning  arguments  of  the  form  (n)  as (n,0)
     rather than as (0,n), so that they are consistent  with
     DIM statements' interpretation of (n).  (SPR 10-7701).

1.0 SUMMARY

     1.1 This release contains various bug fixes and  a  few
     minor  cosmetic improvements; It includes all published
     patches for V.17 and patches to fix all  bugs  reported
     in SPR's up to and including SPR 10-6318.

     1.2 BASIC V.17A runs on monitors 5.02, 5.03, and  5.04,
     and  fully  supersedes all previous versions.  The only
     known deficiency is that the intrinsic  functions  COS,
     COT, and TAN are sometimes only accurate to four digits
     for arguments near integral multiples of PI/2.

     1.4 Incompatabilities between V.17 and V.17A
     In  V.17,  numeric  image  specifications   for   USING
     statements  were  required  to  contain a place for the
     sign of the number in the left part of the field if the
     field specified that the number was to be output with a
     leading sign.  Since the sign of a non-negative  number
     is  output  as a blank space, many users have requested
     that  this  requirement  be  removed  for  non-negative
     output to such fields, provided that the field does not
     contain an exponent specification.  V.17A includes this
     change, because of which, user programs which run under
     V.17 will  function  differently  under  V.17A  in  the
     following  way when they output non-negative numbers to
     such fields:

          If the output overflowed in V.17 because the field
          did not include a place for the sign, in V.17A the
          output will not overflow.  For example:

               10 PRINT USING "##.", 1, 12
          will now output
                1.
               12.
          instead of
                1.
               & 12.

     The intrinsic functions COS, TAN, and COT are sometimes
     only  accurate  to 4 digits for arguments near integral
     multiples of PI/2.

     3.2 Known Documentation Deficiencies
     The   following   are   corrections   to   the    BASIC
     Conversational  Language  Manual  in Notebook #3 of the
     DECsystem-10 Software Notebooks, as it exists as of the
     February  1972  updates.   These  corrections  will  be
     incorporated in a future update to the Manual.

          1.  The warning character which  USING  statements
          output when numeric output exceeds its field width
          has been changed from "%"  to  "&",  in  order  to
          avoid problems with MPB.

          2.  The following execution error messages  listed
          in  Appendix  B,  BASIC Diagnostic Error Messages,
          have been removed:

               ? ILLEGAL DISK READ IN LINE nn
               ? ILLEGAL DISK WRITE IN LINE nn
               ? IMPROPER FIELD IN IMAGE IN LINE nn

             The following  execution  error  messages  have
             been added:

               ? ATTEMPT TO READ# OR INPUT# FROM A FILE
                  WHICH IS IN WRITE# OR PRINT# MODE IN 
                  LINE nn
               ? ATTEMPT TO READ# OR INPUT# FROM A FILE
                  WHICH DOES NOT EXIST IN LINE nn
               ? ATTEMPT TO WRITE# OR PRINT# TO A FILE WHICH
                  IS IN READ# OR INPUT# MODE IN LINE nn
               ? ATTEMPT TO WRITE# OR PRINT# TO A FILE
                  WHICH HAS NOT BEEN SCRATCH#ED IN LINE nn
               ? ATTEMPT TO OUTPUT A NUMBER TO A STRING
                  FIELD OR A STRING TO A NUMERIC FIELD
                  IN LINE nn

          3.  The following  compilation  error  message  is
          new:

               ? CHANNEL SPECIFIER NOT IN CORRECT FORM

          4.  Carriage returns  are  illegal  characters  in
          strings; an attempt to create a carriage return in
          a string will result in  a  fatal  error  message.
          Note  also  that  in quote mode it is not legal to
          output a double quote character in  a  string;  an
          attempt  to  do  so  will  result in a fatal error
          message (BASIC  itself  writes  the  double  quote
          characters which enclose the string.).



5.0 INTERNAL CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM

     Version 17A includes all published patches for previous
     versions, and patches to fix all bugs reported in SPR's
     up through and including SPR  10-6318.   There  are  no
     SPR's  outstanding.   The  list  of  bugs fixed between
     Version 17 and Version 17A is in Appendix A.

APPENDIX A -- BUGS FIXED IN VERSION 17A

     Version 17A includes all of the published  patches  for
     Version 17 and answers to all SPR's up to and including
     SPR 10-6318.

     1.  Multiple numeric LETs  frequently  caused  ill  mem
     refs.  (SPR 10-5654).

     2.  RIGHT$ and MID$ frequently  changed  characters  in
     their  source  strings, caused ill mem refs, etc.  (SPR
     10-5876).

     3.  The TAPE  command  did  not  work  under  the  5.03
     Monitor   (up  to  but  not  including  5.0333).   (SPR
     10-5879).

     4.  QUEUE and STR$ could  wipe  out  some  of  the  low
     segment; STR$ sometimes caused the output of many blank
     spaces.  (SPR 10-5918).

     5.  SAVE to a  device  which  cannot  do  input  worked
     properly,  but  returned  the  spurous  message "? FILE
     dev:filenm.ext NOT FOUND".  (No SPR was submitted).

     6.  CHANGE would not accept null characters.   (No  SPR
     was submitted).

     7.  String compares did not ignore trailing blanks in a
     string.  (SPR 10-6110).

     8.  The alternate names LN and LOGE  are  now  accepted
     for the LOG function.  (No SPR was submitted.).

     9.  The alternate name SQRT is now accepted for the SQR
     function.  (No SPR was submitted.).

     10.  The CAT command will now  catalog  the  SYS:  area
     when  given  device  SYS: as its argument.  (No SPR was
     submitted.).

     11.  An "illegal variable" error message  was  returned
     whenever  an intrinsic function without an argument was
     immediately followed  by  a  statement  keyword  (THEN,
     STEP, etc.).  (SPR 10-6178).

     12.  CHAIN  sometimes  started  execution  of  the  new
     program  at the first line when there was a line number
     argument  which  specified  a  different  line.    (SPR
     10-6219).

     13.  QUEUE returned an error message for LIMIT switches
     which  specified  more  than  999 pages.  (The limit is
     actually   9999   pages.).    (Reported   by   Software
     Evaluation.).
