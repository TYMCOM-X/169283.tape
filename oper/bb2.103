Changes in version 7.0 of Mightychain:

Code which allowed explicit overlay control from machine language
programs has been deleted (with an assembly switch).  This code was
never used because the LOADER feature to go along with it was never
implemented.

The fixed buffer area within the Mightychain program has been
deleted.  Instead, I/O buffers are allocated at the top of core
in the normal manner.  When an overlay is done, Mightychain now
gathers all I/O buffers which were allocated above the top of
the old segment and moves them above the top of the new segment.
This provides several benefits.  The former 2K restriction on
the total size of all buffers no longer exists.  As many files may
now be open as with a non-overlayed program (except for one channel
for the overlay file).  Because the buffer area is not allocated
inside the program, approximately 2K of additional core is available
during load time.  Finally, the DYNARY program may now be used with
overlays.  One important warning about DYNARY with overlays:
There must be no dynamic arrays in existence when an overlay is
performed.  Any subroutine for which dynamic arrays were created
must return to its caller, thus deleting its arrays, without
doing any overlays of its own.  If this rule is violated, there
will be horrendous problems.
