          *<Output file>_<Input file>/Switches

2.2.1  Switches

          nnnnnnF - Dump  a  disk  file  starting  at  block
                    nnnnnn.   The  default is 1 if /F is not
                    specified, 0 if /F is  specified.   Note
                    that block 0 is the RIB.

          nnnnnK - Assume that the file is a save file, dump
                    it  as  a  core  dump,  beginning at loc
                    nnnnnn.

          nnnnnnH - Assume that the file is a  high  segment
                    save file, dump it as a core dump.

          nnnnnnS - Dump the disk beginning at block  nnnnnn
                    (octal) using SUPER USETI.

          nnnnnnT - Stop the dump at nnnnnn (octal).

2.2.2  Default Conditions

The default output file is LPT:name.LST
The default input file is DSK:name.ext.

The default is that the same filename is used as  the  input
and  output  filename.   If  a  backarrow  (_) is not in the
command string, the input file is specified.  An equal  sign
(=)  can  be used in place of a backarrow (_).  REENTER will
close the files.
