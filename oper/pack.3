^MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF ^JUDY ^SMITH WHEN SHE APPEARED FOR
THE INTERVIEW WAS THAT SHE WAS VIVATIOUS, POISED, NEAT, ATTRACTIVE,
AND EAGER.
.PARAGRAPH
^SHE QUICKLY RESPONDED WITH SOUND, WELL THOUGHT OUT REASONS FOR
ENTERING ^COSMETOLOGY AND THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM.
.PARAGRAPH
^ONLY INFRINGEMENT ON HER EDUCATION WOULD BE SHE HAS A PART
TIME EVENING JOB TO HELP COVER THE COST OF HER EDUCATION.
.PARAGRAPH
^THE ONLY HANDICAP SHE APPARENTLY HAS IS A BROKEN LEG FROM A
SKIING ACCIDENT, THE DOCTORS ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT THE CAST
WILL BE REMOVED IN TWO MONTHS AND THERE WILL BE
NO FURTHER COMPLICATIONS.
.PARAGRAPH
^AFTER COUNSELTATION WITH HER EMPLOYER AND FRIENDS, ^JUDY APPEARS
TO BE A WELL LIKED, WELL RESPECTED AND RESPONSIBLE PERSON.  ^ACCORDING
TO THEM SHE IS EVIDENTLY RECEPTIVE TO INSTRUCTIONAL ASSISTANCE.  ^SHE
WAS JUDGED TO BE CAPABLE OF LEARNING NEW SKILLS.

.PARAGRAPH
^UNFORTUNATELY, DUE TO A PREVIOUS CONVICTION OF A FELONY, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
TO ACCEPT JUDY AS A STUDENT SINCE THIS WOULD RESULT IN THE
VIOLATION OF SECTION 7332 (B) OF THE ^COSMETOLOGY ^ACT
WHICH PREVENTS A PERSON CONVICTED OF  A FELONY OR MORALS CHARGE TO BECOME
LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS A COSMETOLOGIST.
