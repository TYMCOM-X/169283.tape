          SYSTAT is called whenever the commands PSP,  SYSNO,  SYSTAT,

          USERS,  WHERE,  or  WHO are typed at command level in either

          MONITOR  mode  or  TYMEX.   Detailed  instructions  for  any

          command  may be obtained by typing the command followed by a

          ? (i.e.  WHO ?).


          SYSTAT will attempt to do output to the logical device  name

          "SYSTAT"  first,  and  then the device name "TTY".  The file

          name SYSTAT.LST will be used on that device, SYSTAT or  TTY.

          If  the user wants to output to the disk, the following will

          cause  all  SYSTAT  output  to  be  directed  to  the   file

          SYSTAT.LST



                    -ASSIGN DSK SYSTAT
                    DSK ASSIGNED

                    -SYSTAT commands

          NOTE: SYSTAT may be replaced by WHERE, WHO, etc.




          SYSTAT will only output information accessible to the user's

          job through the MONITOR.

          Certain fields typed by  SYSTAT  are  given  an  abbreviated

          form.  These fields are described below.


          INITIALIZATION

                    This is the total time the NULL JOB  (JOB  0)  has

                    ran.   The  NULL  JOB runs when for some reason no

                    one else can run.

          The TYMNET field consists of the node  from  which  the  job

          listed  originated  from.  This will either be a remote name

          or a base name.  Also given is the teletype  number  of  the

          job,  and  the  letter  that  was used to identify the job's

          terminal.

                              STATE FIELD

          The OPEN FILES LIST is a list of the open files the user  is

          permitted  to  see.   The  only  field  of which requires an

          explanation is the "MODE" field.  There  are  four  possible

          MODES, which are explainged below:





               DUMP      The file is opened with out any  I/O  buffers

                         (DUMP mode).



               IN        The file is opened with just an input buffer.



               OUT       The  file  is  opened  with  just  an  output

                         buffer.



               UPD       The file is opened with both input and output

                         buffers (UPDATE mode).

                     DISK SWITCH - DISK PERFORMANCE





          This switch enables the user with SYSTAT license to look  at

          the  performance of the system's file structures.  Given are

          the names of each pack (both logical and pack i.d.) and  for

          each pack the number of blocks free, the number of reads and

          writes done on that pack, the number of seeks done  on  that

          pack,  and  the errors the MONITOR has detected on that pack

          (if any).   The  following  table  describes  the  different

          errors that can occur:





          CER            Total  number  of  software  folded  checksum

                         failures  (i.e., the first word of a group is

                         not as expected) for both  MONITOR  and  user

                         I/O.



          HDEV           Total number  of  hard  device  errors  (both

                         channel   and   controller)   on  this  unit.

                         Whenever a  hard  device  error  occurs,  the

                         IODERR error status bit is set for the user.



                   NOTE: that all errors except data parity errors are

                         counted  as  device  errors.   Thus  a search

                         error is a device error.

                         this  unit.   Whenever  a  hard data (parity)

                         error occurs, the IODTER error status bit  is

                         set for the user.



          LBN            Last logical block number  (decimal)  of  the

                         region that had the latest hard data error.



          NTHUNG         Total number of times the unit failed to give

                         a  transfer  done interrupt, and the software

                         was not able to recover.



          PHUNG          Total number of times the unit failed to give

                         a  transfer  done interrupt, and the software

                         was able to recover.



          RER            Total  number  of  rib  redundance  failures,

                         Whenever a rib redundance failure occurs, the

                         IOIMPM  error status bit is set for the user.

                         LOOKUP, ENTER and RENAME UUOs.



          RETRIES        Total number of times the MONITOR retried the

                         last operation that had any kind of error and

                         was recoverable.  Since the user  knows  both

                         the number of retries before recalibrating (1

                         try plus 3 retries for search errors,  and  1

                         try  plus 9 retries for other errors) and the

                         number of recalibrates (10) before the  error

                         is  declared  hard,  i.e., nonrecoverable, he

                         has a clue to the nature of  the  last  error

                         that occured on the unit.



          SER            Total number of SAT failues  (the  number  of

                         free clusteds stores in the SAT block on disk

                         disagreed with the expected number stored  in

                         core).   Whenever  a  SAT failure occurs, the

                         IOIMP error status bit is set for the user.



          SHUNG          Total number of times  the  software  assumed

                         that  a  file  was active and then found that

                         the controller and channel were idle.   After

                         each  time,  the software renews its request.

                         This is probably a software timing error.

          THUNG          Total number of times the unit failed to give

                         a  transfer  done interrupt, and the software

                         was able to recover.



          1CONI          The first CONI status returned  on  the  unit

                         for the last error encountered.



          2CONI          Either the first CONI status  returned  after

                         the   unit  was  recalibrated  or  the  first

                         successful    retry    before    the    first

                         recalibrate.



          1DATAI         The first DATAI status returned on  the  unit

                         for the last error encountered.



          2DATAI         The first DATAI  status  returned  after  the

                         unit was recalibrated.



          1DAT           Total number of times that an error  recovery

                         procedure  was  successfully  carried out for

                         data errors (parity) on this unit.  If a hard

                         data  error  occurs,  the  MONITOR  gives up,

                         increments HDAT, but does not increment 1DAT.

                   NOTE: that all errors except data parity errors are

                         counted  as  device  errors.   Thus  a search

                         error is a device error.  RETRIES  gives  the

                         number  of  tries  it  took  to make the last

                         recovery.



          1DEV           Total number of times that an error  recovery

                         procedure  was  successfully  carried out for

                         device (channel  and  controller)  errors  on

                         this  unit.   If  a hard device error occurs,

                         the MONITOR gives up,  increments  HDEV,  but

                         does  not  increment 1DEV.  Note that RETRIES

                         gives the number of tried it took to make the

                         last recovery.
