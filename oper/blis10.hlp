         BLISS-10 does not  use  the  standard  -10  command  scanner.
         However,  command string interpretation is similar to that of
         other -10 CUSPS.



         .R BLIS10
         *RELFIL,LSTFIL_SRC1,SRC2,...



1.       Each file descriptor [RELFIL,LSTFIL,SRC] has the form:

          DEVICE:FILENAME.EXT[PROJECT,PROGRAMMER]



2.       RELFIL receives the machine code generated by  the  compiler.
         If  no  code  is  desired,  leave  this position empty in the
         command string.  If FILESPEC_ appears, FILESPEC is assumed to
         be the RELFIL spec and no listing output is generated.



3.       LSTFIL receives the program listing produced by the compiler.
         If  no  listing  is desired, leave this position empty in the
         command string.



4.       SRC1,SRC2,...  are  the  BLISS-10  source  files  which  when
         concatenated together form one BLISS-10 module.



5.       If "DEVICE" is omitted "DSK" is assumed.



6.       If "EXT" is omitted, ".REL" is used for the RELFIL, ".LST" is
         used  for  the  LSTFIL,  and  ".B10,"  ".BLI",  and  the null
         extension in that order are tried for the source  file  until
         either a file is found or all three defaults have failed.



7.       If [PROJECT,PROGRAMMER] is omitted for  any  file,  the  user
         project,  programmer  number  is  supplied for that file.  If

         [PROJECT, PROGRAMMER] appears at  the  beginning  of  a  file
         descriptor,  it  becomes  the  default  for all the following
         descriptors  which  do  not   have   a   specific   [PROJECT,
         PROGRAMMER].



8.       SWITCHES: (-) implies that -(switch name) will result in  the
         opposite  of  the switch action.  * indicates that the switch
         is assumed on by default.

         NAME       ACTION

         C          Generate a cross referenced listing.

         E(-)       Expand all MACROs in the listing.

         F(-)       Set  up  stack  frame  register  (SREG)  on  every
                    routine entry.

         G(-)       All routines are to be made GLOBAL ROUTINES.

         H          This entire module is to be loaded into  the  high
                    segment.

         I(-)       Generate special inspection word immediately prior
                    to each routine or function body.

         K          Disable listing of the source text (same as -L).

         *L(-)      Enable listing of the source text.

         M(-)       Enable listing of the machine code generated.

         N(-)       Do not print error  messages  on  the  controlling
                    TTY.

         *O(-)      Optimize subexpressions across all ";"s.

         R(-)       Do not save all  declarable  registers  around  an
                    EXCHJ.

         S          Output routine names as compiled  and  compilation
                    statistics to TTY.

         T(-)       Generate calls to a timing routine  at  the  start
                    and end of each routine.

         U          Do not optimize across ";"s (same as -O).

         V          Entire  module  is  to  be  loaded  into  the  low
                    segment.

         X          Perform  a  syntax  only  (no   code   generation)
                    compilation.
