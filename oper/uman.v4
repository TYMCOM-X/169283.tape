^THIS ^^PROFILE\\ MANUAL IS DIVIDED INTO THREE SECTIONS.

^THE FIRST IS AN INTRODUCTORY EXAMPLE  OF  TYPICAL  ^^PROFILE\\
USAGE,

BEGINNING WITH SIMPLE REPORT GENERATION USING STANDARD 

("DETERMINISTIC")  DATA  AND   PROGRESSING   TO   USAGE   OF
SIMULATION

("PROBABILISTIC") DATA FOR RISK ANALYSIS.


.PARAGRAPH
^THE SECOND SECTION IS A REFERENCE MANUAL FOR THE FREQUENT

USER.

^IT SUMMARIZES ALL THE COMMANDS AVAILABLE IN THE ^^PROFILE\\

SYSTEM AND EXPLAINS THEIR MEANING.

.PARAGRAPH
^THE THIRD SECTION IS INTENDED TO HELP
THE ANALYST EVALUATE HOW ^^PROFILE\\ COULD MEET HIS NEEDS.
^IT CONTAINS A DISCUSSION OF THE OVERALL CAPACITIES OF
^^PROFILE\\, HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIRED, AND THE
PERTINENT ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THE OUTPUT
REPORTS.

.SKIP 1
.PARAGRAPH
^AS AUTHORS OF ^^PROFILE\\, WE ARE GRATEFUL TO  THE  MANY  PEOPLE
WHOSE SUGGESTIONS AND IDEAS PROVED SO VALUABLE.  ^FURTHER

SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS ARE WELCOMED.

^THE ^^PROFILE\\ FORECASTING SYSTEM SERVES AS AN AID TO  BUSINESS,
  GOVERNMENT,  AND  EDUCATIONAL  PLANNERS.   ^MOST  OFTEN
^^PROFILE\\  IS  USED  TO  FORECAST  THE  FINANCIAL   EFFECTS   OF
ALTERNATIVE  MANAGEMENT  DECISIONS.   ^YET ^^PROFILE\\ CAN ALSO
QUICKLY TABULATE AND  DISPLAY  NICELY  FORMATED  MANAGEMENT
REPORTS CONSISTING OF HISTORIC INFORMATION.


.PARAGRAPH
^THE ^^PROFILE\\ SYSTEM IS CONCEPTUALLY EASY TO  UNDERSTAND  YET
HIGHLY  FLEXIBLE.   ^THE USER WRITES A SERIES OF "RULES",

^USING ^^PROFILE\\ TO RUN A  MONTE  CARLO  SIMULATION  IS  A
DIRECT EXTENSION OF NORMAL REPORT GENERATION.


^^PROFILE\\ PERFORMS A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION BY AVERAGING  MANY
"TRIAL" FORECASTS. EACH TRIAL IS IDENTICAL TO A
SINGLE FORECAST EXCEPT  THAT DATA VARIABLES CAN TAKE ON
DIFFERENT TRIAL VALUES FROM WITHIN A SPECIFIED RANGE.


.PARAGRAPH
^AT THE START OF EACH TRIAL  FORECAST,  PROBABILISTIC  DATA
VARIABLES  ARE  ASSIGNED  VALUES  "SAMPLED"  FROM  THEIR
ASSOCIATED PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION.   ^DETERMINISTIC  DATA
VARIABLES  (CONSTANTS  AND  VECTORS) WILL BE ASSIGNED THE
SAME VALUE AT THE START OF EACH TRIAL.  ^THUS  THE  RESULTS
OF  ONE  TRIAL FORECAST REPRESENT ONE POSSIBLE SET OF FUTURE
OCCURENCES.  ^THE NEXT TRIAL  FORECAST  WHICH  IS  RUN  WILL
REPRESENT  ANOTHER  POSSIBLE SET OF FUTURE OCCURENCES.  ^IF
MANY TRIALS ARE  RUN,  THE  RESULTS  OF  ALL  TRIALS  SHOULD
REPRESENT  A  REASONABLE CROSS-SECTION OR "^^PROFILE\\" OF ALL
POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE FUTURE.


.PARAGRAPH
^WHEN A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION IS RUN, THE RESULTS  OF  ALL
TRIALS  ARE  AVERAGED TO GENERATE THE STANDARD REPORT, WHICH
THEN REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE OF ALL POSSIBLE FUTURES.   ^YET
ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION  HAS BEEN GAINED VIA THE MONTE CARLO
SIMULATION PROCEDURE.  ^FROM THE PROFILE  OF  ALL  FUTURES,
THE  DECISION  MAKER  CAN  BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EXTREMES OF
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE - IN OTHER WORDS, HOW "GOOD"
 HE MIGHT EXPECT THE FUTURE TO BE, OR CONVERSELY, HOW "BAD"
IT MIGHT BE.  ^THE CHANCES THAT AN  OUTPUT  VARIABLE  MIGHT
ATTAIN  A  FUTURE  VALUE ARE READILY COMPUTED BY ^^PROFILE\\ AND
SHOWN TO THE USER IN  THE  FORM  OF  A  "^RISK  ^PROFILE".
^THESE  SAME  PRINCIPLES  CAN  BE  USED  TO  GENERATE  RISK
PROFILES  OF PRESENT   VALUE   CALCULATIONS,   FUTURE   VALUE
CALCULATIONS, OR INTERNAL RATES OF RETURN.

.PARAGRAPH
^TO PERFORM A RISK ANALYSIS WITH  ^^PROFILE\\,  THE  USER  MUST
FIRST  DECIDE  WHICH  DATA  VARIABLES  SHOULD  BE DEFINED TO
INCLUDE UNCERTAINTY.  ^SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN THIS DECISION
ARE  CONSIDERATION  OF  HOW  MUCH EACH INPUT MIGHT VARY, AND
WHAT THIS VARIABILITY MIGHT MEAN ON KEY CRITERIA  CHOSEN  BY
THE  USER.   ^FOR  EXAMPLE,  A  VARIABLE  WHICH  IS  HIGHLY
UNCERTAIN  AND  WILL  HAVE  SIGNIFICANT  IMPACT  ON  THE   CHOSEN
CRITERIA, MAY BE BEST EXPRESSED AS A PROBABILISTIC DATA VARIABLE.
(^CONVERSELY, AN UNCERTAIN DATA VARIABLE WITH LITTLE IMPACT MAY MORE
PROFITABLY BE LEFT AS A FIXED INPUT.)  ^THE DECISION
MAKER CAN USE ^^PROFILE\\, VARYING FIXED INPUTS TO GAIN A  BETTER
UNDERSTANDING OF THE CRITICAL UNCERTAIN DATA VARIABLES.
