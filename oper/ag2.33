                                                (REF: A.G.2.33)

        TYMEX, VERSION 73, HAS THE FOLLOWING IMPROVEMENTS INCORPORATED
INTO IT.  THEY ARE THE ONLY CHANGES.

/FTF BUGS FIXED SUCH THAT THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE IS FOLLOWED FOR
FTF HANDLING:

1.  A FILE WITH THE .FTF EXTENSION IS ALWAYS COMPILED USING FTF40

2.  A FILE WITH THE .F4 EXTENSION IS COMPILED WITH F40 UNLESS /FTF
    APPEARS AS A PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY SWITCH FOR THAT FILE.

3.  A FILE WITH A NULL EXTENSION IS COMPILED WITH THE CURRENT STAND-
    ARD PROCESSOR (INITIALLY F40;  MAY BE CHANGED WITH THE /FTF OR
    OTHER SWITCHES).

THUS, /FTF IS LIKE OTHER COMPILER TYPE SWITCHES (/MACRO,ETC.) EXCEPT
THAT IT APPLIES TO BOTH NULL AND .F4 EXTENSIONS (OTHERS ONLY APPLY
TO NULL EXTENSIONS).

4.  IF ANY FILE IS COMPILED WITH FTF40, THE LOADER IS INSTRUCTED TO
    USE FTLIB40 INSTEAD OF LIB40.
