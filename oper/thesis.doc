             REPRESENTATION AND DESCRIPTION OF CURVED OBJECTS

                                 ABSTRACT


       A  representation  is  proposed  in  which three-dimensional
       objects  are  represented  by  data  structures  composed of
       primitives called  generalized cylinders.   These primitives
       consist of a space  curve or "skeleton" and a  cross section
       which may vary along the length of the  skeleton.  Apparatus
       and programs are described which obtain depth information by
       scanning  objects  with  a  laser  and   television  camera.
       Results are presented from  a set of programs  which analyze
       the laser-derived depth information and segment objects into
       primitives  describable as  generalized  cylinders.  Methods
       are  proposed  whereby  a  program  may   generate  complete
       descriptions of complex curved objects.

                             1  INTRODUCTION



       My  present interest  in representation  and  description of

       curved   objects  arose   from  a   desire  to   extend  the

       capabilities of  the Stanford  Hand-Eye System  [Feldman] to

       recognize  a  wider  class  of  objects  than  plane-bounded

       solids.   Initial  attempts  to  recognize  geometric cones,

       cylinders,  and  spheres  were  not  carried  far  enough to

       demonstrate  the   usefulness  of  existing   techniques  in

       recognizing   this  limited   addition  to   the   class  of

       recognizable   objects.   But   there  appears   to   be  no

       insurmountable barrier to doing so.



       It soon became apparent that little useful purpose  would be

       served by this limited extension.  A significant improvement

       in performance of vision  systems would come only  when they

       were  capable of  recognizing the  sort of  everyday objects

       that a  robot of  the future  might have  to deal  with.  To

       accomplish this, we make use of two new tools or techniques.



       The first of these is a representation general  and flexible

       enough  to carry  varied  information about  an  object, its

       parts,   and   their   relation   to   one   another.    The

       representation  we  propose  will  allow  several  different
       1.0  INTRODUCTION                                     Page 2


       models for primitives or parts of objects.  These models may

       include prototypes of  various sorts.  The  particular model

       we present in  this paper, generalized cylinders,  is useful

       for  describing  a  large  class  of  natural  and  man-made

       objects.  It describes in a natural and intuitive way pieces

       which possess elongation, or which have axial symmetry.  The

       generalized cylinders may be linked together in various ways

       to  form complex  objects.  The  most  significant departure

       from   previous   methods  of   description   is   that  the

       representation  is essentially  a volume  representation, as

       opposed  to a  surface  representation.  Section  2  of this

       report  describes  in detail  representation  by generalized

       cylinders, and gives some  examples of how objects  might be

       modelled with such a representation.



       The  second  new  technique  is  the  use  of  direct  depth

       measurement for recognition.  Every two-dimensional image of

       a three-dimensional scene is ambiguous, in that there are an

       infinite number of realizable physical objects (or groupings

       of  objects)  which could  give  rise to  the  image.  These

       ambiguities  may be  resolved only  by  a priori assumptions

       about  the nature  of the  scene.  The  use of  direct depth

       information  eliminates  the need  for  assumptions  such as

       squareness of  corners, requirements that  stored prototypes
       1.0  INTRODUCTION                                     Page 3


       exist for every possible object in a scene, or  knowledge of

       the  reflective  characteristics  of  surfaces.   Section  3

       describes a ranging system, which obtains  depth information

       by triangulation, using a laser and a television camera.



       The test of any vision system must be how well it deals with

       actual objects.  Sections  4 and 5 describe  an experimental

       system to  generate descriptions  of physical  objects, from

       depth data derived from the ranging system.  The  system has

       so far given good  results in describing some  simple curved

       objects, and  has been  moderately successful  in describing

       parts  of  complex objects.   Some  results may  be  seen in

       Figures  .   Section  6  contains  some  suggestions  for

       further research.



       So  far we  have  not achieved  our goal  of  recognition of

       complex objects; we cannot yet identify a given object, say,

       as a humanoid figure or as a hammer.  But we hope our method

       of representation and our work in description of objects has

       laid the groundwork for progress in this area.



       I would like to express my appreciation for the guidance and

       assistance  of  my  advisor,  Dr.  Thomas  O.  Binford.  His

       insight has  been helpful  on many  occasions.  Many  of the
       1.0  INTRODUCTION                                     Page 4


       original ideas  on which  this research  is based  were his,

       including  generalized  translational  invariance,  and  the

       basic configuration of a laser ranging system.



       Thanks  are  also due  to  Dr. Arthur  L.  Schawlow  for the

       generous loan of a laser, to Victor Scheinman for the design

       and assembly of  the laser deflection apparatus,  to Richard

       Underwood  for routines  for the  numerical solution  of the

       generalized eigenvalue equation,  and to Bruce  G. Baumgart,

       R.  K.  Nevatia,  and  J.  M.  Tenenbaum  for  their helpful

       comments and suggestions.
