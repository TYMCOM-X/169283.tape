          Due to the advancement  in  scientific
          haircoloring,   the  cosmetologist  of
          today needs extensive knowledge in the
          theory    and   application   of   the
          materials.  We will  be  learning  the
          structure of the hair, its content and
          the reaction  of  the  materials  that
          shall  be  used  in  the  operation of
          changing the natural hair color.

               There    are    many    different
          procedures  involved  relating  to the
          operations that shall be performed  by
          the  student.   Every manuafacturer of
          coloring   products   have    theirown
          directions for application and we will
          be exploring many of these.

          (Major Concept)
          Haircoloring involves the  process  of
          changing  the  natural hair color to a

          Before application  you  will  give  a
          pre-disposition  test.   There are two
          methods.

          If the ------ is positive, refuse  the
          patron,  and if negative the hair will
          accept   color.    Then   check    the
          condition of the scalp.
