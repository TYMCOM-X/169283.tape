THE FILE AMP AS IS CAUSES AN ERROR MESSAGE - "NO DC CONVERGENCE"
IF I REPLACE THE DIODE D25 WITH A -.3VOLT SOURCE, EVERYTHING
WORKS FINE AND THE ANSWERS HAVE BEEN VERIFIED. TO CHECK FURTHER,I
DELETED MOST OF THE CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION SO THAT ALL I HAD WAS
A PULSE SOURCE IN SERIES WITH THIS DIODE ,IN SERIES
WITH R1 WHICH I RETURNED TO GROUND. LO AND BEHOLD - STILL NO DC
CONVERGENCE. THIS CASE OF PUTTING A DIODE(USUALLY A SHOTTKEY
BARRIER DIODE IN THE INPUT, IS A VERY COMMON DESIGN PROCEDURE.
SPICE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT WITH NO DIFICULTY. WHY 
DOESN'T IT!?!?!?!?!?!?
THANKS,BILL CONIS.
