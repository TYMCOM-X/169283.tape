*VERSION 17   05/22/72

WHEN SAVING FILES CREATED AFTER A CERTAIN TIME, FAILSAFE WILL NO
LONGER DO A LOOKUP ON FILES WHICH WERE CREATED BEFORE THAT TIME.  THIS
CAUSES NO CHANGE IN OPERATING PROCEDURES, BUT IT WILL MAKE BACKUPS
SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER.

THE COMMANDS /Z, /Y, AND /T HAVE BEEN ADDED TO ALLOW THE OPERATOR
TO RESTART A MULTI-REEL SAVE.  WHEN A REEL IS FINISHED, FAILSAFE NOW
PRINTS THE NAME OF THE NEXT FILE TO BE DUMPED AS WELL AS THE
PPN OF THE USER WHOSE FILE IT IS.  IF THE /S IS INTERRUPTED, THE 
OPERATOR SHOULD CALL FAILSAFE AGAIN, AND USE THIS INFORMATION TO SET
UP THE STARTING PPN AND FILE FOR THE NEXT REEL. /Z FOLLOWED BY A PPN
WILL MAKE FAILSAFE START WITH THAT USER.  /Y FOLLOWED BY A
FILE NAME WILL MAKE FAILSAFE START WITH THAT FILE.  IF NO /Y IS
TYPED, OR IF IT IS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY A CARRIAGE RETURN,
FAILSAFE WILL START WITH THE FIRST FILE IN THE USER'S DIRECTORY.
/T IS USED TO SET THE REEL NUMBER OF THE NEXT TAPE TO BE USED.  IT IS
NOT NECESSARY THAT THIS COMMAND BE USED, BUT IT SHOULD MAKE IT
EASIER TO KEEP TRACK OF WHICH TAPE IS WHICH.  THESE STARTING
PARAMETERS ARE ALL ZEROED AFTER THEY ARE USED BY THE /S COMMAND, SO
IF ANOTHER RESTART IS NECESSARY, THEY MUST BE RETYPED.  AS AN EXAMPLE
OF THE USE OF THESE COMMANDS, LET'S SAY THAT AN ALL FILES IS INTERRUPTED
AFTER THE SEVENTH TAPE HAS BEEN COMPLETED, AND THAT THE FILE AND PPN
PRINTED AT THE END OF THE SEVENTH TAPE IS FILE.EXT[6,22766].  THE
OPERATOR SHOULD TYPE /T8 SO IT WILL START WITH THE EIGHTH REEL,
/Z6,22766 SO IT WILL START WITH THAT USER, AND /YFILE.EXT SO IT
WILL START WITH THAT FILE.  THEN HE SHOULD TYPE /S TO CONTINUE
SAVING FILES ON TAPE.  THESE COMMANDS WILL ALSO WORK FOR BACKUP OR ANY
OTHER /S OPERATION WHICH REQUIRES MORE THAN ONE TAPE.
