                     WIRRAP--WIRE-WRAPPING PROGRAM

WIRE-WRAP:  FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS                           PAGE   2



          This is the functional specification for  a  Tymcom-X  program
     for  the  generation and documentation of wire-wrap circuit boards.
     The  program,  called  "WIRRAP",  will   permit   the   generation,
     manipulation,   and  documentation  of  a  data-base  describing  a
     specific wire-wrap implementation.

          A wiring board consists of an arbitrary  set  of  sockets--not
     necessarily all similar; each of which may be located anywhere upon
     the board.  Each socket has a unique identification  or  name,  and
     consists of an arbitrary set of pins.  Each pin within a socket has
     its own name.  Each pin and  socket  may  have  certain  attributes
     associated with it.

          For example, a pin may be BUSSED: that is, connected to  other
     pins on the board by fixed wiring.  In that case, since connections
     already exist between these pins, the program should  not  generate
     redundant  wiring.  Simularly, a socket may be an edge connector on
     the board, and will impose certain constraints on any  wiring  nets
     which include edge pins.

          One  section  of  the  program  id  devoted  to  creating  and
     maintaining   board  descriptions,  and  to  the  generation  of  a
     data-base  file  for  a  specific  circuit  implementation.    This
     data-base  contains  the  description  of the board, and is used to
     produce the specific circuit implementation.

          A second section of the program is devoted to  the  generation
     and  maintainence  of libraries of plug descriptions.  A plug is an
     entity which may be attached to a socket.  Each different  type  of
     plug  has  a unique name: it also has a set of pins.  Each plug-pin
     may  have  certain  attributes  associated  with  it.   A  plug  is
     described by defining each pin--and its attributes--associated with
     the plug.

          A third section of the program is used to enter  circuit  nets
     into a data-base: a net is the the list of all pins which are to be
     connected  together,  and  has  a  net  (signal)   name.    Certain
     constraints  are imposed on any net: no pin is to contain more than
     two wires; the total length of the wire used for a  net  is  to  be
     minimized.   Nets  are defined via a list of descriptors.  For each
     descriptor, the corresponding pin on  the  board  is  located,  and
     linked into the appropriate net.

          Additional sections  of  the  program  are  used  to  document
     various information about the circuit implementation contained in a
     data-base, and to modify a  data-base  and  generate  documentation
     (change orders) concerning those modifications to the data-base.

              A PROGRAM FOR DEVELOPMENT OF CIRCUIT BOARDS


                               John Kopf
                             March 22, 1973


          Wirrap is a program used  to  generate  and  document  circuit
     boards,  particularly  those which are "wire-wrapped", but which is
     also useful for back-panels, etc.  It is used to enter data into  a
     specialized  form  of  data-base, to change the data in an existing
     data-base of the correct form, and  to  permit  the  generation  of
     various  documents relating to the information in the data-base, in
     forms suitable both to  humans  and  to  other  machines,  such  as
     automatic drilling and wirewraping machines.


          The data-base is a diskfile, and contains information relating
     to  the  specific  board used, and the wiring superimposed thereon,
     and may in  addition  also  contain  information  relating  to  the
     individual elements plugged into the board.


          During a working session, the data-base specified is copied to
     a set of working files, which are modified.  Only at session-end is
     the data-base replaced with a new, updated version.

            INTRODUCTION


                     1.2   BASIC PROGRAM STRUCTURE


          The wirewrap program is divided  into  independent  functional
     units.   Each  of  these is invoked via a specific command.  When a
     unit is active, additional commands specific to that  unit  may  be
     used.


          Units are invoked via the general command form:

               UNIT [USING/USE filename] <c/r>


          The functional unit names and usage are:
           BOARD         generate and edit board descriptions, generate
                             data-base for wiring.
           PLUG          generate and edit plug descriptions.
           ENTER         generate and edit wiring descriptions.
           CHANGE        modify existing data-base (change orders).
           DOCUMENT      generate various documents relating to the
                             data-base.


          These functional units are described  in  more  detail  below.
     BOARD  and  PLUG  may be used independently of any specific circuit
     implementation, since they provide  specialized  editing  functions
     for certain types of input.


                      1.3   RESTRICTIONS ON USAGE


          There are certain restrictions on  the  use  of  the  program.
     These may be removed in later versions, but will exist in the first
     version.  These are as follows:

               1.3.1 A plug must match or be a subset of any  socket  it
     is used in.  this restriction rules out the use of plugs which span
     several sockets.  It is necessary  because  of  the  difficulty  of
     searching  for  matching pins on sockets and plugs, especially when
     one or another may be rotated in its description.

               1.3.2 Plug pins must be described in the  same  order  as
     the  socket  pins  used.   This is especially true if the plug is a
     subset of the socket (e.g., if a 4-pin ic is plugged into a  16-pin
     socket, then plug pin names do not correspond to socket pin names).

            INTRODUCTION


               1.3.3 There is no guarantee of correctness in the use  of
     plugs  in the specific case where they do not fill the socket used,
     unless each plug pin description has a  coordinate  assigned,  such
     that appropriate plug pins may be associated with the corresponding
     plug pins by means of their relative positions.

            DESCRIPTION OF A BOARD


                       2.  DESCRIPTION OF A BOARD


          This functional unit is invoked via the command:

               BOARD [USING/USE file]


          If FILE is specified, it is used as a source file  for  input.
     Such  a  file  may  be  generated  either  via  the editor or via a
     previous usage of the wirewrap program where the board  description
     was saved.


          A board is described by a set of  english-language  statements
     which define various elements of a board.


          The board description language permits  one  to  define  board
     elements  using  either primatives (individual pin descriptions) or
     previously  defined  board  elements.   Various   commands   permit
     verification  of elements; editing of elements; and generation of a
     board description file for input to the wirewrap program.


          2.1 pins, sockets, and groups

          The basic element is the pin.  A pin has  certain  attributes.
     These attributes are as follows:

           ID            The label of the pin.
           X             The X-position (in inches) of the pin, relative
                             to some arbitrary point (normally the first
                             pin in the list...pin "1").
           Y             The Y-position of the pin (like X).
           BUSS          The pin is not "pluggable", but is instead
                             connected to a buss bar on the board. 
      Bussed
                             signals will be treated differently than
                             non-bussed signals.
           DRILL         This element is not a pin, but instead
                             describes a hole which must be drilled in
                             the circuit board.  Drill elements have no
                             identification, and are not accessible from
                             the data-base.


          A socket is  a  collection  of  pins  and  drill  holes.   The
     attributes of the pins are attached to the socket.

WIRE-WRAP:  FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS                           PAGE   7
            DESCRIPTION OF A BOARD


          A group consists of a list of pins  and/or  other  groups  and
     their  attributes.  if a list entry is another group, it is treated
     in a special fashion.  The position of the sub-group  is  taken  as
     the  point  of reference for each sub-sub-group.  For example, if a
     socket has been defined as an array of pins,  located  relative  to
     pin "1", then a group defined as an array of sockets, each of which
     has a (X, Y) specified, defines the position of  each  pin  in  the
     array of sockets.


          2.2 valid names, and their construction

          If a group is given an id "A" (via use in  another  group  and
     itself  has  subgroups  "1",  "2", ..., then the sub-groups are now
     identified by the identifications "A1", "A2", ...,  and  these  new
     identifications are unique.


          However, since it is frequently convenient to  refer  to  pins
     within a socket, and since a socket is the last element in a group,
     it is desirable to distinguish the socket pins in some  way.   This
     is  done  by  the  use  of the dash "-".  Pin "3" of socket "A1" is
     referenced, not as 'A13', but  instead  as  "A1-3".   A  subsequent
     reference  to pin "A1-5" may then be abbreviated as "5", as long as
     no other group element has been referenced in the meantime.


          An element is normally given an identification using the  form
     "ID",  which  causes  normal  id  concatination as described above.
     However it may be desirable to define an id which is  not  used  as
     part  of the element id.  In this case it is permissable to use the
     form 'ID'.  This construct  is  dangerous  however,  since  it  may
     introduce ambiguity.


          Element definitions are followed by an arbitrary length  list.
     Each  list  element  is terminated by the character ";", except for
     the last element which is terminated by the  list  terminator  ":".
     Various  terms  in the list element are optional, and are specified
     in the list description by [option].  other terms must  be  one  of
     several  forms  which  are  designated  by  form1/form2.   Posative
     numbers are specified by nn.n,  and  may  be  any  decimal  number.
     Within  a  list,  imbedded  carriage  returns  and  line-feeds  are
     ignored, and may be used to improve readability.  EXAMPLES OF  LIST
     ELEMENTS


               2.2.1 ["spid"/'spid'/DRILL] [X = nn.n], [Y=nn.n];

WIRE-WRAP:  FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS                           PAGE   8
            DESCRIPTION OF A BOARD


          This is the general form of list element for a  pin.   if  the
     identification  is  not  used,  the last id is incremented by 1 and
     used again.  Thus if the last id was "2", the default would be "3".
     Note  that  no  carries  are  propagated,  thus  "9" is followed by
     garbage, and not by "10".


          If no X position is specified, the last one defined  is  used.
     The  same  rule  applies  to Y.  If both X and Y are specified, the
     line may be abbreviated as:

               'spid'/"spid"/DRILL nn.n, nn.n;


          Indeed, if only one number is specified, it  is  taken  as  X.
     The  alternate forms are only to make the source more readable, and
     to avoid ambiguity.


               2.2.2 "spid" nn.n, nn.n;

          This defines pin "spid" at the appropriate X and y position.


               2.2.3 DRILL nn.n, nn.n;

          This specifies that a hole will be drilled at the  appropriate
     X and Y coordinate.


               2.2.4 "spid" BUSSED "sigid" nn.n, nn.n;

          This specifies that the designated pin is a bussed  pin.   The
     signal  "sigid" is the signal assigned to the buss attached to this
     pin.


               2.2.5 "spid"Y=nn.n;

          This specifies that the previous value of X is to be used.


               2.2.6 "spid" nn.n;

          This specifies that the old value of Y is to be used.   It  is
     not necessary to specify "X=", since the first value is taken to be
     X unless otherwise defined.

            DESCRIPTION OF A BOARD


               2.2.7 "GID" USING/USE gid X = nn.n, Y = nn.n;

          This is the general form using a group/socket definition as an
     element  of  a  new group.  The word "USING" specifies that a group
     definition is to be used instead of defining a pin.


          2.3 socket definition

          A socket is defined by the statement:

               SOCKET DEFINITION socid: list:

       The socket named "socid" is defined.  The list may  only  contain
     pin or drill descriptions.


          2.4 edge socket definition

          An edge socket is defined by the statement:

               EDGE SOCKET DEFINITION socid: list:

       This is completely equivalent to a socket definition, except that
     a  flag  associated with the socket is set, indicating that this is
     an edge socket/connector.  This permits the capability  of  calling
     out documentation relating to edge connectors as a specific type of
     element, with any attributes associated with the card/board  as  an
     element itself.  Plugs may not be used with edge sockets.


          2.5 group definition

          A group is defined via the statement:

               GROUP DEFINITION id: group list:

       Id is the name given to this  definition.   The  group  list  may
     contain any valid list element.


          2.6 listing a definition

          A definition may be listed in tabular form via the command:

               PRINT id

       All attributes for a  definition  are  printed,  including  those
     which  were  defined  by  default.   Appropriate control tokens are

            DESCRIPTION OF A BOARD


     inserted to correspond  to  a  complete  description  input.   List
     generates  an  image  of the text generated, if the save command is
     used.


          2.7 editing a definition

          A definition may be edited via the command:

               EDIT id

       The attributes for a list definition are printed, line  by  line.
     each  line  is terminated by the text "O/K? Y/N".  if "y" is typed,
     it is accepted and the next line is performed.  If  "n"  is  typed,
     the line is repeated, element by element.  Each element is followed
     by "?", and the program waits for input.   A  value  typed  of  the
     appropriate  form  will  replace  the  original  value.  A carriage
     return accepts the current value.  At the  end  of  the  line,  the
     entire new line is repeated with the normal message.  At the end of
     a definition, the message "ANY MORE, Y/N" is output.  At this  time
     additional elements may be entered.


          2.8 wire routing

          A list of wiring channels may be defined by the command:

               WIRE CHANNEL[S] x/y: list:

       Where LIST consists of one or more real  numbers  for  X  (or  Y)
     which  specify  channels  through which wires will be routed.  Note
     that wiring will be generated point-to-point  unless  one  or  more
     channels  are  defined  before the data-base is generated.  In this
     case, each wire will  be  routed  from  its  pins  to  the  nearest
     channel, and then all routing will lie within channels.


          2.9 saving a board description

          A board description may be saved using the command:

               SAVE ON file

       The board description will be written out (in long form)  to  the
     file specified.

          A drilling tape may be generated with the command:

               DRILL TAPE file USING id

       The description of definition ID is expanded and  output  in  the
     correct t for a drill paper-tape onto FILE.


          2.11 generation of data-base file

          A data-base file may be generated via the command:

               GENERATE file USING id

       The definition ID is expanded,  ignoring  drill  points,  and  is
     output  to  FILE.  The file is the new data-base, and is in correct
     form for subsequent description of the wiring to be implemented.

          Define a board consisting of 4 rows of 3 columns  of  sockets,
     each  of which has 8 pins and 2 bussed pins, and also has 2 drilled
     holes.  We can say:

                        3   DESCRIPTION OF PLUGS


          "PLUGS" are those elements which may be inserted into sockets.
     A  plug for one board may be an integrated circuit; for a different
     board, such as a back-panel, a plug may be an entire card,  perhaps
     generated by a previous wirewrap program usage.


          A plug may  be  described  in  such  a  fashion  that  certain
     attributes  may  be  assigned to each pin of the plug, and all such
     values may then be invoked by calling out the plug to insert into a
     socket.   Examples  of  simple  attributes might be load and source
     capability, or standard signals assigned to specific pins, such  as
     +5V and GND.


          The plug functional unit is invoked by the command:

               PLUG USING/USE file


      Where FILE is the name of a plug library.  This need not exist  at
     the time of invocation.


                         3.1     Plug libraries


          A library may be defined, which contains  descriptions  of  an
     entire  family  of  plugs.   For  example,  the library "TTL" might
     contain plugs labeled "SN7400", "SN7401", "SN7410", and "SN7420".


          By specifying "TTL" in a library definition, one may then call
     out the appropriate data for SN7400 whenever desired.


                      3.2     Definition of a plug


          A new plug is defined by the command:

               DEFINE plgid: list:


      The current plug library is searched for the name "PLGID", and  if
     not  there,  the  LIST is copied into a plug description in memory.
     If it already is there, a message is output that "PLUG  IS  ALREADY

WIRE-WRAP:  FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS                           PAGE  13
            DESCRIPTIONS OF PLUGS


     DEFINED"  and input of the list is aborted, the program expecting a
     new command.


          LIST may be of two forms.  If the first word is "FROM", as in:

               FROM file:


      Then the file "FILE" is read to get the LIST.  This permits a plug
     description to be generated by the editor and entered later.


          The second form of LIST entry is:

               "ppid" attribute list;


      the pin identification "PPID" is assigned to  this  pin,  and  the
     attribute list is associated with it.  Attributes may be left null,
     or  undefined,  but  will  in  that  case  not  be  available   for
     documentation.


                   3.3     Editing a plug description


          A plug description is edited by the command:

               EDIT [plgid]


      If plgid is not specified, the  most  recent  plug  referenced  is
     used.   Otherwise  the specified plug is checked to determine if it
     is the current plug, and if  not,  editing  is  aborted  until  the
     program  determines  what  to do with the current plug description.
     If the current plug has not been changed, and a good copy exists in
     the  library,  then  it  is  deleted  and  editing  continues.  The
     specified plug is located in the current plug library, brought into
     the current description area, and editing proceeds.


          The plug identification is output, followed by  editing  lines
     for each pin of the plug description.  Each line output is followed
     by the text "OK? Y/N If "Y" is typed, the next line  is  generated.
     If  "N",  then  the  line is repeated, element by element, and each
     element is followed by "?".  The element may be accepted by  typing
     a  carriage  return, or changed by entering the appropriate form of
     new value.  when the entire line for  a  pin  has  been  processed,

            DESCRIPTIONS OF PLUGS


     editing  is continued for that line (the line is repeated), and for
     succesive lines.  When all lines have been output, the message "ANY
     MORE,  Y/N" is output.  If Y is typed, DEFINE is entered; if N, the
     edit is complete.


              3.4     Replacing a library plug description


          The command:

               ENTER PLUG


      Causes the current plug description to be written  into  the  plug
     library.  If the current plug id is a new id, it is appended to the
     library; if it already exists in the library, it will  replace  the
     old  description.   The  plug  library  directory is ordered in the
     order of plug definition.  Replacing the plug description does  not
     change the directory ordering.


                       3.5     The plug directory


          The command:

               DIRECTORY


      Causes the directory of plugs in the current library to be listed,
     along with the number of pins on each plug.


                  3.6     Plug attribute list elements


          Each pin of a plug may have a number of attributes  associated
     with it.  These are described below.  On definition, attributes are
     input in any order, and are separated by commas (",").

             3.6.1 Pin identification.  The  pin  identification  is  of
     form:

                    "ppid"/'ppid',


      Where Ppid is the name of the pin, such as "1".

WIRE-WRAP:  FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS                           PAGE  15
            DESCRIPTIONS OF PLUGS


             3.6.2 Pin X-position.  The form of this attribute is:

                    X=nn.n,

             3.6.3 Pin Y-position.  The form of this attribute is:

                    Y=nn.n,

             3.6.4 Default signal.  the form is:

                    SIGNAL = sigid,


      Where SIGID is the name of any signal to be assigned to  this  pin
     by default, such as GND.  Default signal names may be overridden at
     the time a plug is assigned to a socket  along  with  signals,  but
     their  use permits the option of not specifying constant pin usage,
     such as +5V, and GND.

             3.6.5 Group specification.  this specification is of form:

                    GROUP groupid(n),


      Where N is an optional number designating a specific, multiple-use
     group number.  If not specified, the group is group 1.  The purpose
     of group specification is to link all pins associated with a unique
     element  on  a  plug, so that these elements may be used in certain
     forms of documentation.  For  example,  if  a  plug  contains  four
     independent  2-input  nand  gates,  the  pins  of each one could be
     specified as an  independent  group,  as  in:  NAND2(1),  NAND2(2),
     NAND2(3), and NAND2(4).  It is then possible to document the use of
     all elements labeled NAND2.

             3.6.6 Sub-group specification.  This  specification  is  of
     form:

                    SUBGROUP subgroup-id(n),


      Where N is an optional  number  specifying  a  specific  subgroup.
     Usage  is like that in 3.6.5, except that subgroups are elements of
     a single group, with common  elements.   For  example,  a  pair  of
     latches  (group)  may  have  a  common  reset,  and  so  each latch
     (sub-group) is not entirely  independent,  since  the  use  of  the
     second  latch can only be done if the usage requires the same reset
     signal.

            DESCRIPTIONS OF PLUGS


             3.6.7 Input logic type.  The specification:

                    INPUT LOGIC TYPE = typid,


      Permits documentation concerning logic type conflict verification.

             3.6.8 Output logic type.  The specification:

                    OUTPUT LOGIC TYPE = typid,


      Permits the same sort of checking as described in 3.6.7.

             3.6.9 Input load specification.  The specification:

                    INPUT LOAD = nn.n,


      Specifies the  input  load  value  in  arbitrary  units.   If  not
     specified,  a  unit  load  is  assumed,  provided  any  other input
     parameters are specified.

             3.6.10 Output drive specification.  The specification:

                    OUTPUT DRIVE = nn.n,


      Specifies the output drive in arbitrary units.  If not  specified,
     a  default  drive  capability  corresponding  to  8  unit  loads is
     assigned, provided any other output parameters are specified.

             3.6.11 Unused input flagging.  The specification:

                    INPUT TIE no float/up/down/float ok,


      Specifies, for documentation purposes, how unused pins of  a  plug
     group/subgroup are to be flagged.  no float is the default case, if
     any other input parameters are specified.

             3.6.12 Output wired-or flagging.  The specification:

                    OUTPUT WIRE-OR require/ok/forbidden,


      Specifies, for documentation purposes,  how  signal  strings  with
     multiple outputs are to be flagged.  forbidden is the default case,
     if any other output parameters are specified.

            DESCRIPTIONS OF PLUGS


          A given pin  may  be  specified  BOTH  for  input  and  output
     independently,  since  there  are some plugs in existance which use
     the same pin for both input and output.  However, any documentation
     which  is  generated  using  such a device and which computes total
     load for an entire signal string should be taken with  a  grain  of
     salt.


                      3.7     Plug pin attributes


          The attributes described in section 5 above are tabulated here
     to show the form of heirarchy defined.

            ENTERING SIGNALS INTO THE DATA-BASE


                4    ENTERING SIGNALS INTO THE DATA-BASE


          Once the data-base for a circuit has been generated using  the
     BOARD  functional  unit, we are ready to enter data into it.  To do
     this we give the command:

               ENTER USING file


      Where FILE is the name of the data-base to be used.


          Data consists of a set of signal names  and  the  relationship
     between plugs, sockets, and signal names.


          If the use of plug descriptions  from  a  plug  library(s)  is
     desired,  then  before any reference to a plug in the library it is
     necessary to give the command:

               USE PLUG LIBRARY/LIBRARIES libfile [,libfile]


      Where libfile is the name of the file containing  descriptions  of
     plugs.   It  is  necessary to use this command only once during the
     course of a circuit implementation, since the  names  of  all  plug
     library names are kept as part of the data-base.


                       4.1    Valid signal names


          A signal name consists of  one  or  more  characters  with  no
     imbedded  blanks.  The character set used for signal names includes
     all alphabetic and numeric characters, as well as the characters +,
     , /, and  .  Signal names are limited to 10 characters.


          Certain characters are reserved for special functions.  One of
     these  is  the character $.  If $ preceeds an element in a list, it
     is flagged as a  signal  source.   This  information  is  used  for
     certain of the documents generated.


          It is frequently desirable to have the program define a signal
     name  which  has  no significance to the logic.  The character * is
     used to define a new signal name.  A command is provided to  permit
     the definition of defined signal format names.

WIRE-WRAP:  FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS                           PAGE  20
            ENTERING SIGNALS INTO THE DATA-BASE


          The character string ** is used to refer to the most  recently
     used  signal  name  defined.  Other recently defined signals may be
     referenced by means of expressions of the form **-3.  Note that  **
     changes its value each time * is referenced.


          The format of a  defined  signal  may  be  specified  via  the
     command:

               SIGNAL FORMAT A.A9.9


      The characters A.A may be any valid signal name not including  the
     digit  9.   The  characters  9.9  may  be  any  number  of 9's, and
     specifies the number of digits appended to the defined signal name.
     Each  time  * is used, the number used in this digit string will be
     incremented by 1.  The default signal format is  Z999.   This  will
     cause successive signals Z001, Z002, Z003, ...  to be defined.


          The name of a signal may be changed using the rename  command.
     The format of this command is:

               RENAME sig1 AS sig2


      If SIG1 does not exist, a comment is output  and  the  process  is
     ignored.   If SIG2 already exists, the two signal lists are merged.
     Rename applies to signals already defined.  If the  rename  command
     is  followed  by  a  command defining SIG1, a new entry for SIG1 is
     defined, rather than converting the new SIG1 to SIG2.


          A use for this function is in renaming the signals defined  in
     the  original  board  description  for bussed signals.  In one data
     base, we may wish to refer to  a  buss  as  "+5V";  in  another  as
     "+15V".


                   4.2    Entering signal by pin list


          The form of this command is:

               WIRE SIGNAL sigid: bpid, bpid, [spid]:


      Signal SIGID is assigned to the successive board pins.  Note  that
     if two pins of the same socket are tied to a signal, the second and

WIRE-WRAP:  FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS                           PAGE  21
            ENTERING SIGNALS INTO THE DATA-BASE


     succeeding references to the socket may be via a socket pin  (SPID)
     abbreviation.   Thus  the list A4-2,A4-7,A4-9 may be abbreviated as
     A4-2, 7,9.  This holds true if no ambiguity will exist.


          A special form of this command is:

               WIRE EXACT SIGNAL sigid: list:


      This causes the pins to be wired in the exact sequence  presented.
     (Pins  are  normally  wired such that in the final wiring sequence,
     source pins are at one end of the sequence, and edge  pins  are  at
     the  other  end.   This  prevents  the  splitting of signals in two
     directions.  however, in some special cases it may be desirable  to
     wire in some other sequence.  This command permits this.)


                   4.3    Entering signals by socket


          To wire all signals  going  to  a  specific  socket  into  the
     specific  wiring  strings  associated  with  each  signal, we use a
     command of the form:

               WIRE SOCKET socid: sigid, sigid, [(spid)]sigid, ...:


      The socket with the socket identification socid  is  located,  and
     successive  signals SIGID from the list are assigned to the pins of
     the socket.  The order of assignment is that used in  the  original
     socket  definition.  A specific socket pin may be called out by use
     of the list element format (SPID)SIGID.   This  causes  socket  pin
     SPID  to  be  located  and the signal assigned to it.  A successive
     signal will be assigned to the next pin in sequence, unless  a  new
     SPID is called out.


                    4.4    Entering signals by plug


          A plug in a plug  library  may  be  referenced,  placed  in  a
     socket, and have signals assigned to the pins.  This causes various
     attributes of the plug to be made available for documentation.  The
     form of the command is:

               PLUG plgid INTO socid: sigid, sigid, [(ppid)]sigid, ...:

WIRE-WRAP:  FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS                           PAGE  22
            ENTERING SIGNALS INTO THE DATA-BASE


      This causes plug PLGID to  be  located,  assigned  to  the  socket
     SOCID,  and  the  list  of signals to be assigned to the successive
     plug pins.  The same rules apply as described  under  section  4.3,
     except  that the names of the pins are those of the plug.  This may
     be significant if the plug does not fit the socket exactly.  (e.g.,
     placing a 14-pin I.C.  into a 16-pin socket.)

            DOCUMENT GENERATION


                        5   DOCUMENT GENERATION


          For the purpose of this program,  a  document  is  a  complete
     description  of  a set of attributes for an entire board.  This may
     be a file suitable for listing on the lineprinter, or it may  be  a
     file  used to generate a paper tape, for use in automatic wire-wrap
     machines or in an automatic drilling machine.


          The DOCUMENT functional unit is invoked by the command:

               DOCUMENT USE/USING file


      Where FILE is the data-base to document.


                    5.1    Manual wire wrap listing


          The command:

               WIREWRAP


      Will generate a listing for the purposes of  manual  wirewrapping.
     the  sequence  of  wrapping  is  as follows: first all wires on the
     lower level or wrapping plane are installed.  This is  followed  by
     the  second layer of wraps.  For each layer of wraps, the first set
     of wires placed are those which correspond to the  bussed  signals,
     which  are  normally  power  and  ground.  These are normally wired
     completely within the region of  each  socket.   Because  they  are
     wired  first  within  each  layer,  they will normally be buried by
     successive sets of wires.  Once the bussed signals are  wired,  all
     other signals are wired in some arbitrary order.


          The result is that on the end of the first  layer,  each  post
     should have at most ONE wire upon it.  On the second layer, no post
     should ever have more than TWO wires on  it.   In  addition,  those
     posts  which  have  an upper layer wire ONLY will be flagged in the
     listing with the symbol "$", indicating a single wire on the pin.

            DOCUMENT GENERATION


          The command to generate a symbolic wire list is:

               PRINT SIGNALS


      The signals are listed in alphabetical order.   Each  signal  will
     have associated with it a list of the form described in 7.1.


                     5.3    Wire wrap control tape


          The command used to generate a tape for an automatic  wirewrap
     machine is:

               WRITE TAPE ON file


      Where file is the output file to which the control information  is
     written.   The  sequence  of  wiring  is  the same as that for 5.1,
     above.


                        5.4    NC drilling tape


          This function is described  in  the  chapter  "description  of
     board", and may be invoked ONLY in that functional unit.


                           5.5    Post counts


          The command:

               POST COUNT


      Will  generate  a  map  of  the  board  with  all  pins  in  their
     approximate  position  indicated  by  the  digit  0, 1, or 2.  This
     number corresponds to the number of wraps on that pin (post).


                            5.6    Plug map


          This command will print a map showing each socket by name  and
     the plug(s), if any, assigned to it.

                 5.7    Socket map and cross references


          The command:

               SOCKET MAP


      Will cause the listing of each socket, in the form given  in  7.2.
     A  map  will  be  generated  for  each  socket,  even if empty.  In
     addition, the (X, Y) coordinate of the first pin will be listed.


                      5.8    Map of unused sockets


          The command:

               UNUSED SOCKETS


      Will cause the printing of a map of all unused sockets, as in 7.6,
     except that the file will be formatted for the printer.


                       5.9    Map of unused plugs


          The command:

               UNUSED PLUGS


      Will cause the printing of a list of  all  unused  plugs  and  the
     sockets they are assigned to.


                    5.10   Map of unused plug groups


          The command:

               UNUSED GROUPS


      Will cause the printing of all unused plug groups, as  in  section
     7.7,  except  that  the  list is not restricted to a single type of
     group.

                  5.11   Map of unused plug subgroups


          The command:

               UNUSED SUBGROUPS


      Will cause the printing  of  all  unused  plug  subgroups,  as  in
     section  7.8,  except  that  the list is not restricted to a single
     type of subgroup.


              5.12   Definition of current board as a plug
     The command:

               ADD EDGE socid TO file WITH NAME plgid


      Will cause the edge socket labeled SOCID to  be  set  up  in  plug
     library  format  and  added  to the plug library FILE with the plug
     name PLGID.  This feature permits the subsequent use of the current
     implementation  as  a  plug,  for  use when wiring back-panels, for
     example.  The only default signal names  specified  will  be  those
     with  the  bussed  attribute.   For  each  signal going to the edge
     connector, load and drive will be summed and the  appropriate  form
     of  load/drive specification will be generated for each pin.  Drive
     will be set if any pins in the signal net  are  designated  sources
     with  the  WIRED-OR FORBIDDEN attribute.  Otherwise load/drive will
     depend on the net.

            GENERATING CHANGE ORDERS


              6     CHANGING A DATA-BASE AFTER GENERATION


          A data-base may be edited while a prototype is being developed
     with  no  ill  effects.   However,  it sometimes occurs that in the
     middle of production, a change must be made, both to existing units
     and  to  future production units.  It is desirable, for the purpose
     of uniform documentation, that existing units be changed to exactly
     reflect the wiring sequence of future units.


          The functional unit change permits the generation of documents
     describing  changes  to  the  existing  units, and also updates the
     data-base.  The form of this command is:

               CHANGE file


      Where FILE is the data-base to be edited.


                          6.1    Moving a plug


          The command:

               MOVE PLUG plgid FROM socid/bpid TO socid/bpid


      Causes all plug descriptions initially associated with  the  first
     socket  (FROM)  to  be  removed  and instead attached to the second
     socket (TO).  The process aborts with an appropriate error  message
     if  the first socket has no plug, or if the plug specified does not
     agree with the plug used at the socket, or  if  the  second  socket
     already has a plug.  Signals are not transfered with the plug.


                         6.2    Placing a plug


          The command:

               ADD PLUG plgid TO socid/bpid


      Causes the specified plug to  be  assigned  to  the  socket.   The
     process is aborted if the socket already has a plug.

            GENERATING CHANGE ORDERS


                         6.3    Removing a plug


          The command:

               REMOVE PLUG plgid FROM socid/bpid


      Causes the specified plug to be  removed  from  the  socket.   The
     process  is  aborted  if  the  socket  has  no plug, or if the plug
     specified does not agree with the plug used there.


                         6.4    Moving a signal


          The command:

               MOVE SIGNAL sigid FROM bpid TO bpid


      Causes the specified signal to be removed from the first  pin  and
     instead  attached  to  the  second pin.  Routing of the net remains
     unchanged.  No more than three wires will have  to  be  lifted  and
     stored  using  this command.  However, the wiring generated may not
     be optimum according to minimum wire length.


                  6.5    Removing a signal from a pin


          The command:

               REMOVE SIGNAL sigid FROM bpid


      Causes the specified signal (at the specified pin) to  be  deleted
     from the net, and may require that most of the net be rewired.


              6.6    Adding a set of pins to a signal net


          The command:

               ADD SIGNAL sigid [BEFORE/AFTER bpid]: list:


WIRE-WRAP:  FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS                           PAGE  29
            GENERATING CHANGE ORDERS


      Causes the individual list elements to be  inserted  in  the  best
     place in the net.  If the optional part of the command is used, the
     net must already be defined, and the list  is  wired  in  the  best
     order at the location specified.


                      6.7    Adding a net to a net


          The command:

               ADD EXACT SIGNAL sigid [BEFORE/AFTER bpid]: list:


      Causes the list to be entered into the specified position  of  the
     net  in  the  specified order.  It is inserted in the best place in
     the net, unless the optional part of  the  command  is  used.   The
     actual  point in the net will depend both on the new length, and on
     the number of wires to remove and place.


                      6.8    Transfering a signal


          The command:

               TRANSFER SIGNAL sigid FROM bpid TO bpid


      Causes the specified signal to be deleted at the original pin, and
     re-inserted in the best place in the net at the new location.  Both
     wire length and number of wires to remove and replace will be  used
     to decide the new position in the net.

            7       ADDITIONAL DATA-BASE GENERATION FEATURES


          During the  use  of  functional  units  ENTER,  document,  and
     CHANGE,  it  is  frequently desirable to be able to look at certain
     features of the data-base.  A set of  commands  enable  one  to  do
     this.


                           7.1    List signal


          To look at a given  signal,  and  determine  the  pins  it  is
     associated with, the command used is:

               LIST SIGNAL sigid


      The signal name is listed, along with the list of pins it goes to.
     The list is ordered in wiring sequence.


                           7.2    List socket


          To look at a given socket,  and  list  information  associated
     with it, the command used is:

               LIST SOCKET socid


      A map of the socket is output, which  includes  each  pin  of  the
     socket,  the  signal associated with the pin, which pin it is wired
     from, and which pin it is wired to.   If  one  or  more  plugs  are
     associated  with  that  socket,  additional  information is output.
     This includes the type of plug  at  each  pin,  and  the  plug  pin
     identification.


                            7.3    List load


          To look at a given signal, and list the total  load  or  drive
     capability,  and the load or drive at each pin that signal goes to,
     the command used is:

               LIST LOAD sigid

WIRE-WRAP:  FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS                           PAGE  31
            LISTING INFORMATION


      The signal load/drive is output, and the list of  pins  with  each
     pin's load/drive is generated.


                           7.4    List length


          To look at a given signal and extract  information  about  the
     lengths of wire used, use the command:

               LIST LENGTH sigid


      The signal name and total length of wire used  is  output,  and  a
     list  of pins with the wiring distance between each pair of pins is
     output


                          7.5    List conflict


          To look at a signal and determine if any  conflicts  exist  in
     usage, such as inconsistant logic levels, use the command:

               LIST CONFLICT sigid


      The signal name is output, and either the message "OK" or  a  list
     of conflicts and the associated pins is output.


                       7.6    List empty sockets


          This command causes a search of the data-base to be made,  and
     outputs  a  list  of  all sockets with both no signals and no plugs
     assigned.


                       7.7    List unused groups


          A search is made of all sockets, and for each socket with  one
     or  more pins associated with a plug but no signal, a determination
     is made if that plug pin is part of the specified group, and if all
     parts of that group are unused.  If so, the socket, plug, and group
     pins are output.  The form of the command is:

            LISTING INFORMATION


               LIST UNUSED GROUP groupid


                      7.8    List unused subgroups


          This command is identical to the previous command, except that
     instead of searching for unused plug groups, it searches for unused
     plug subgroups.  The command form is:

               LIST UNUSED SUBGROUP subgroupid


                 7.9    Specification of documentation


          The command:

               LIST ON file


      Specifies that the change orders generated are to  be  written  on
     FILE for subsequent printing.

                           DRILL FILE FORMAT 




          Upon  accepting  a  "DRILL  TAPE  ON  FILE"  command,   WIRRAP
     generates  a  binary  file  containing  drilling information.  This
     drilling information is not specific  to  any  particular  drilling
     machine, but instead contains all information necessary to generate
     a drill tape which is machine specific.


          This section describes the binary file  generated  by  WIRRAP.
     Knowledge  of  the file format permits the creation of a program to
     transcribe the information for any specific drilling machine.


          The file is formatted into two-word binary records.  The first
     4 records contain specific information about the file.  This is:

       Record    Word        Contents
     ----------------------------------------
         1        1          ASCII character string 'DRILL'
                  2          ASCII character string ' TAPE'
         2        1          XMIN, floating point
                  2          XMAX, Floating point
         3        1          YMIN, floating point
                  2          YMAX, floating point
         4        1          -0-
                  2          NPOINT:  number of successive records


          The ASCII strings may be used to verify that this is indeed  a
     drill tape.  The max and min values correspond to the boundaries of
     a box surrounding the set of holes drilled.


          Each successive record describes one hole to be drilled.   The
     first  word contains the floating point value for the x-coordinate;
     the second the y-coordinate.

          Upon  accepting  a  "WRITE  TAPE  ON  FILE"  command,   WIRRAP
     generates a binary file containing wiring information.  This wiring
     information is not specific to any particular wiring  machine,  but
     instead  contains all information necessary to generate a wire tape
     which is machine specific.


          This section describes the binary file  generated  by  WIRRAP.
     Knowledge  of  the file format permits the creation of a program to
     transcribe the information for any specific wiring machine.


          The file is formatted into twelve-word  binary  records.   The
     first  record  contains  specific information about the file.  This
     is:

       Word        Contents
     ------------------------
         1           NREC:  integer number of records in the file
         2           ASCII character string 'WIRRA'
         3           ASCII character string 'P WIR'
         4           ASCII character string 'E FIL'
         5           ASCII character string 'E    '
         6           XMIN:  minimum value of X on board
         7           XMAX:  maximum value of X on board
         8           YMIN:  minimum value of Y on board
         9           YMAX:  maximum value of Y on board


          The ASCII strings may be used to verify that this is indeed  a
     wire tape.


          Each successive record describes one wire to be  placed.   The
     format of each record is:

       Word  Contents
     ---------------------------
         1   LEVEL:  .true. if upper level wrap
         2   X1:  x-coordinate of first wire-end
         3   Y1:  y-coordinate of first wire-end
         4   X2:  x-coordinate of second wire-end
         5   Y2:  y-coordinate of second wire-end
         6   NWORDS: number of words in this record

         7   X3:  x-coordinate of first bend
         8   Y3:  y-coordinate of first bend
         9   X4:  x-coordinate of second bend
        10   Y4:  y-coordinate of second bend
        11   X5:  x-coordinate of third bend
        12   Y5:  y-coordinate of third bend


          NWORDS  is  an  integer  between  6  and  12,  inclusive.   It
     specifies  the number of words in the record, and also indicates if
     wiring is point-to-point or picture-frame.  If greater than 6,  the
     additional  words  are  the coordinates of bends in the wire.  That
     is, if NWORDS = 12, the wire run is:

   PIN(X1,Y1)---BEND(X3,Y3)---BEND(X4,Y4)---BEND(X5,Y5)---PIN(X2,Y2)


          A given wire in picture-frame wiring may thus have up to three
     bends  in  it's length, or may have none.  The total length of wire
     used is the sum of the wire lengths between the points.  The actual
     location  of  the  bends  may  be  significant for certain types of
     automatic wiring machines.
