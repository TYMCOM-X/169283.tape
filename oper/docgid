INTRODUCTION
.skip 1
     This Documentation Guide is a collection of standards, procedures, models
and documentation aids for achieveing consistency and high quality in all formal
documentation produced by the Technical Division.
.paragraph
     It applies to all Division personnel who are involved, however remotely, with
 producing formal documentation. Formal documentation is any descriptive
and structured write-up of software or hardware, other than that
created for very limited use, appearing either on a computer system or in a 
conventional publication. It is normally produced as a direct result of the 
development and release of Tymshare software or hardware, and is for use within the
Company. This formal documentation is referred to in the following sections of this
guide as "documentation" or "documents".
.paragraph
     All formal documentation such as manuals, handbooks and user guides will be
produced in accordance with this guide. Digressions from this guide can be allowed
to satisfy exceptional user requirements, but anyone who wishes to digress from this
guide must be prepared to justify his digression to the Quality Assurance
Technical Writer.
.paragraph
     Other formal documentation such as specifi cations, proposals or reports 
should be produced in accordance with this guide when appropriate. The Quality
Assurance Technical Writer maintains a collection of various document models
for specifications, proposals and reports. He will furnish such models to any
person who wishes to use them in writing his own specification, proposal or 
report.

SECTION 1
.skip 1
.center
RESPONSIBILITIES
.skip 1
1.1  GENERAL
.skip 1
.paragraph
     A document goes through three major phases from the time it is first thought
of to the time it is finally delivered. These three phases are preparation and
submittal, review and approval, and production, in that order.
.skip 1
.paragraph
     Responsibility for these phases is spread over several different areas of the
Technical Division. This section explains who is responsible for what in each
phase, while section 2  explains the steps within each phase, and section 3 
establishes standards to be followed when producing documents covered by 
this guide.
.skip 1
.paragraph
     Documentation in the Technical Division occurs in two ways: a programmer 
generates it, or the Quality Assurance Technical Writer generates it. In this
document "writer" always means the Quality Assurance Technical Writer.
.skip  2
1.200pROGRAMMER
.skip 1
.paragraph
     Whether a document is generated by a programmer or the writer, the programmer's
foremost concern is technical accuracy and completeness of coverage. He is
depended on to provide accurate technical information, not to compose or to edit.
When he has prepared his document in accordance with paragraph 2.4 of this
guide, he submits it to the writer. At this point primary responsibility for the
document is assumed by the writer, although the programmer is still responsible
for technical content.
.skip 1
.paragrap

     A programmer is responsible also for reviewing and approving any document 
sent to him for review and approval. He should make any changes necessary on his
review copy, fill out the appropriate portions of the traveller accompanying his copy,
and return the copy with its traveller to the writer by the deadline shown on the
traveller.
.skip 1
.paragraph
     Each reviewer of a document is responsible for returning his copy of the
document with its filled-out traveller to the writer by the date shown on the
traveller. If a reviewer cannot meet the deadline for a valid reason, he must so
inform the writer. Otherwise, failure to return a document by the deadline shown on
the traveller signifies the reviewer's approval of the document as is.
.skip 2
1.3  QUALITY SSURANCE TECHNICAL WRITER (WRITER)
.skip 1
.paragraph
     If the writer generates a document, he is responsible for collecting all
source data from every reliable source. Besides preparing the document
in accordance with sections 2 and 3 of this guide, he verifies all information in a
document for technical accuracy and completeness of coverage by discussion or
review with appropriate personnel.
.skip 1
.paragraph
     The writer is resposible for choosing the best format for documenting. The
normal formats are Reference Manuals, User Guides, and Quick References. These are
discussed in greater detail and illustrated in section 2. He is also responsible
for maintaining a document information file on the system. This
file is described in the *6NEWS file.
.skip 1
.paragraph
     If the writer accepts a document for editing and production  that was generated
by someone else, he observes the guidelines established in this guide.
.skip 1
.paragraph
     If a document is subject to formal review and approval, the writer is responsible
for monitoring the review and for obtaining approval as described in paragraph 2.5.3.
.skip 1
.paragraph
     Except in very rare cases, all documents are edited by the writer before they
are published. Editing is in accordance with guidelines provided in 
 sections 2 and 3 of this guide. Standard editorial marks are used. (See
appendix A).
.skip 1
.paragraph
     The writer uses illustrations to present material wherever they
would be the best, most practical means of communicating the meaning. He either 
obtains the services of the Publication Services Group in the Marketing
Division, or uses the services of an outside illustrator, or produces illustrations
himself as described in paragraph 4.2.3.
.skip 1
.skip 1
1.4  SECRETARY
.skip 1
1.4.1  ^&Typing Responsibilities\&
.skip 1
.paragraph
     The secretary is responsible for typing assignments handed her by the writer.
All typing will comply with the guidelines provided in sections 2 and 3 of this
guide. Secretaries will not edit text, but will type material exactly as it is 
submitted to them. If they should have questions about punctuation, wording or
formatting, they are responsible for asking the writer  - not the programmer - 
to resolve them before continuing with the typing.
.skip 1
.paragraph
     Before begin ning a job, check for instructions from the writer that would 
appear on the inside front cover of the folder containing the material to be
typed.
.skip 1
1.4.2  ^&Related Responsibilities\&
.skip 1
.paragraph
     Unless a document is to be printed by an outside vendor, the secretary is
responsible for reproducing documents on one of the Xerox machines at Tymshare,
in accordance with guidelines given to her by the writer.
.skip 1
.paragraph
     The secretary is also responsible for distributing copies and masters of
documents as described in paragraph 2.5.8 of this guide.
.skip 2
1.5  QUALITY ASSURANCE ANALYST
.skip 1
.paragraph
     For software items, the Quality Assurance Analyst who reviewed or cleared
the software being documented will also be responsible for reviewing the corresponding
document in draft form. The analyst should make any changes necessary on his
review copy, fill out the appropriate portions of the traveller accompanying his
copy, and return the copy with its traveller to the writer by the deadline shown on the
traveller.
.skip 1
.paragraph
     If an analyst does not return his copy of the document to the writer by the
deadline shown on his copy's traveller, such action signifies the analyst's approval
 of the document as is, unless the analyst informs the writer that he cannot
meet the deadline for a valid reason.
.skip 2
1.6  GROUP MANAGER
.skip 1
.paragraph
     Each group manager is responsible for reviewing and approving any document 
sent to him for review and approval. The manager should make any changes necessary on
his  review copy, fill out appropriate portions of the traveller accompanying the
copy, and return the copy with its traveller to the writer by deadline shown on the
traveller.
.paragraph
     If a manager does not return his copy of the document to the writer by the
deadline shown on the copy's traveller, such action will signify the manager's 
approval of the document as is, unless the manager informs the writer that he cannot
 meet the deadline for a valid reason.

BASIC DOCUMENTATION PROCEDURES
.SKIP "
2.1  INTRODUCTION
.SKIP 1
.paragraph
     After a request for generation has been received by the writer, or after a
documentation portfolio has been submitted to the writer, he will be responsible
for these tasks, as applicable: gathering data, writing, editing, proofreading,
and ensuring that documents are produced in accordance with this guide. In this
document, "writer" always means the Quality Assurance Technical Writer.
.skip 1
2.2  DOCUMENTATION PORTFOLIO
.SKIP 1
2.2.1  ^&Purpose, Scope and Responsibilities \&
.paragraph
     The documentation portfolio is an expandable folder with a
reusable label, supplied by the writer. It is
used by the Technical Division during project development as an accumulation point
 for potential documentation sources, and after release of a project as a working
file for documentation.
.paragraph
     This procedure applies to all personnel in the Technical Division and to all
software produced by them. It should be used whether the product is a small
program or a complex system, even if documentation requirements are uncertain. A
documentation portfolio must be opened at that point when development of a project
begins.
.paragraph
     Primary responsibility under this procedure lies with the writer and the
portfolio manager. The portfolio manager is the project leader or a project
member designated by him, or the programmer-in-charge, or an originating
programmer.
,skip 1
2.2.2  ^&Before Software Release\&
.skip 1
^&Step 1\&
.paragraph
     At that point where development of a begins, the portfolio
manager obtains a documentation portfolio from the writer. The writer prints the
name of the project and the name of the portfolio manager on the portfolio's
label before giving it to the portfolio manager.
.skip 1
^&Step 2\&
.paragraph
     From  the point when a project is begun until its resulting software is first
transmitted to Quality Assurance, the portfolio manager maintains the portfolio.
He is resposible for collecting all material which qualifies for inclusion in it.
.paragraph
     Material which qualifies for the portfolio is any data which might be useful for
post-development documentatin by the writer. Examples of such data are:
.skip 1
     Specifications                    Development Requests
     Specification Changes              Programmer's Notes
     Symbolic Listings                 Sample Runs
     Meeting Notes                     Bug Reports
     Existing Manuals                  Quality Assurance Notices
     Vendor Literature
.paragraph
     If material which belongs in the protfolio is also needed elsewhere during a
project, a copy or copies should be reproduced with the original being placed in the
portfolio. If material which belongs in the portfolio is too bulky or resides in the
computer, a reference to it and its location must appear in the portfolio.
.skip 1
^&Step 3\&
.paragraph
     When a project is first transmitted to Quality Assurance, the 
portfoli o manager transfers its corresponding portfolio to the writer. The
protfoli o must be transferred at this point whether documentation has been
requested or not.
.skip 1
2.2.2  ^&After Software Release\&
.skip 1
^&Step 1\&
.paragraph
     When a portfolio is transferred to the writer so is the responsibility for it.
At the transfer, it becomes a working file for the exclusive use of the
writer and ir retained by him in his office.
.paragraph
     Any material qualifying for the portfolio after the portfolio has
been transferred to the writer must be submitted directly to the writer. He
accumulates such material in the portfolio and uses it for either an
original document or for document updating , as appropriate.
.skip 1
^&Step 2\&
.paragraph
     If a portfolio has been transferred to the witer but the project which it covers
is cancelled or delayed, the writer must be informed immediately. The writer retains
the portfolio but takes no actin action on it
until instructed to do so. 
.skip 1
2.2.4  ^&Documentation Update Use\&
.paragraph
     If an existing document for which the writer has retained a portfolio 
needs updating, the writer uses any material he has been accumulating in that
portfolio as source data for the updating.
.paragraph
     If existing software is substantially revised or if revisio n of existing
software results in its name being changed, a new portfolio should be opened to
cover that revision.
.skip 2
2.3  DOCUMENTATION FORMATS
.PARAGRAPH
     To communicate informatio as clearly as possible and to keep documentation
responsive to users' needs, three different formats for documentation are used. 
These formats are named Reference Manuals, User Guides, and Quick
References (see figure 2-1). Every formal document other than specifications,
proposals and reports should be presented in one of these three formats. However,
if some other format is more suitable and can be justified, that format may be used.
.paragraph
     Normally, a reference manual is exactly what the name implies; it is
lengthy and covers a subject as completely as necessary for a Technical Division user.
It should include a table of contents, and is sectionalized by topic. It should
include glossaries, appendixes or indexes when feasible.
.paragraph
     Normally, a user guide is an informal newsletter-type of publication which
announces or describes a subject in five pages or less. It is also used as a cover
sheet in chaange packages for document modification (see paragraph 2.6.2).
.paragraph
     Normally, a quick reference is a collection of tables, graph, 
lists, cross references or indexes which provide instant answrs to questions
regularly asked by Technical Division programmers about a particular subject.
.paragraph
     For specifications, proposals and reports, the writer maintains a collection
of various models. He will furnish such models to any person who
wishes to use them in writing his own specification, proposal or report.
.skip 2
2.4  PREPARATION AND SUBMITTAL FO DOCUMENTS
.skip 1
2.4.1  ^&Procedures For Programmer\&
.paragraph
     Documents generated by persons other than the writer, such as a programmer,
must be prepared as described in the following list.
.skip 1
    
    

     a. The document should be in completed draft form, and should have
         been reviewed by other appropriate personnel if such a review is helpful.
.skip 1
     b.  The top sheet must be a title page showing - at least - title of
         document, name of programmer, month and year.
.skip 1
     c.  The document must be stripped, burst and loose leaf.
.skip 1
     d.  The document must be the original, but may be typed or handwritten, or
         a computer listing.
.skip 1
     e.  r each page consecutively.
.skip 1
     f.  Sectioalize the material.
.skip 1
     g.  Double space typed material, including any index and any table of
         contents. In hadnwritten material, leave enough space between 
         lines and in margins for editing marks.
.skip 1
     h.  Create an index, or mark in text those items to be indexed, if
         the nature of the material warrants an index.
.skip 1
     i.  Show any directions to the writer o the title page.
.skip 1
     j.  If the programmer places the document in a file, that file must be
         accessible to the writer and secretary.
.skip 1
     k.  If the document is a manual or a similar publication, the writer
         creates a table of contents as described in paragraph 3.3.3.
.paragraph
     Once prepared as described in the preceding list, documents must be 
submitted to the writer for production.
.skip 1
2.4.2  ^&Procedures For Writer\&
.skip 1
2.4.2.1  General Rules
.paragraph
     Documents generated by the writer must be prepared in accordance with 
applicable  portions of the preceding paragraph, 2.4.1. Also, they must be
edited, and illustrated if necessary, as described in paragraphs 2.4.3 and 2.4.4.
.paragraph
     In preparing a document, there are three main guidelines: do not change the
meaning, edit consistently, and produce the best quality document within 
the time allotted.
.paragraph
     The cardinal rule is that a finished document must remain as technically 
correct as the original draft. Another rule for editing is to determine whether the
material conforms to ccepted usage, grammar and punctuation. If these requirements are
 satisfied and the intent of the exposition is clear, the material should not be
changed.
.skip 1
2.4.2.2  ^&Editing Guidelines\&
.skip 1
     a.  Material submitted for typing should be as clear as the writer 
         can make it.
.skip 1
     b.  Where titles of sectios, paragraphs, or illustrations are long or
        detailed, they should be shortened without losing context.
.skip 1
     c.  Check material for proper level of headings, indention, 
        paragraph numbering, and security markings. Mark clearly for typist.
.skip 1
     d.  Check and correct text for misspellings, incomplete constructions,
        punctutation faulst, dangling participles, inconsistencies in
         numbers, incorrect relative pronouns, awkward tenses and moods,
        split infinitives, too-long sentences and paragraps, and excess
         verbiage.
.skip 1
     e.  Correct inconsistencies in capitalization, abbreviations, 
         compounding, and nomenclature.
.skip 1
     f.  Check for correct sequence of table, figure, reference and equation
         numbers. Be sure all figures, references, and table are properly
         called out in the text. Make sure tables are not labelled as figures
         and vice versa. When material contains phrases like "as shown below"
         or "given below", change them to a phrase that does not contain the
         word "above" or "below" ("as just stated"; "as shown in the
         following paragraphs"; "the recently mentioned routine"; etc.). This
         prevents the ambiguity of finding the phrase "as given above" at the
         top of the page, or "as given below" at the bottom of a page.
.skip 1
     g.  Query appropriate programmer on ambiguous statements, undefined 
         terminology and incomplete references to other works.
.skip 1
     h.  Edit all illustrations. These include figures, tables, and
         diagrams.
.skip 1
     i.  Proofread all typed drafts by comparing them with their originals.
         Check the following:
.skip 1
         1. Format, headings, paragraph numbering, pagination.
.skip 1
         2. Word divisions at the end of lines, abbreviations, acronyms,
            typographical errors and spelling.
.skip 1
         3. References to illustrations and paragraphs or sections.
.skip 1
         4. Numbers and placement of illustrations.
.skip 1
         5. Table of contents, list of figures, list of tables and index,
            if any. If any of these items are missing when a document is
            submitted to the writer, the writer will produce the item
            as explained in this guide.
.skip 1
     j.  Give whatever instructions necessary to the secretary regarding
            typing, artwork, reproduction of masters and distribution.
.skip 1
2.4.2.3  Illustrating Guidelines
     a. Center artwork in such a way as to provide a pleasing appearance.
.skip 1
     b. Do not exceed the marginal limits on a page.
.skip 1
     c. On figures, leave space  for typing the figure title below the
        drawing; on tables, leave space for typing the table title above
        the table.
.skip 1
     d. Draw and type carefully so as to present a neat, uncluttered 
        appearance.
.skip 1
     e. Give careful attention to uniformity o line weights and to neatness
         of line junctions.
.skip 1
     f. Identify each piece of art to show where it appears in a document.
.skip 1
.skip 1
2.5  PRODUCTION PROCEDURE
.skip 1
2.5.1  ^&Editing\&
.paragraph
     The writer edits all documents submitted to him in accordance with this guide.
Editing includes marking the copy for typing, rewriting as necessary,
questioning the appropriate programmer and reviewing any editorial changes with the
appropriate programmer. It also includes ensuring that all  necessary 
ingredients are present and prepared in accordance with this guide.
.skip 2

2.5.2  ^&Draft Typing\&
.paragraph
     The secretary types drafts given to her by the writer in accordance with this
guide. Once she has been given a document by the writer for typing, she accepts changes to 
it only from the writer.
.paragraph
     Once the draft is typed, the secretary reproduces the number of copies
requested by the writer for review and returns the original draft in its manila
folder with copies to the writer.
.skip 2
2.5.3  ^&Review and Approval\&
.paragraph
     A document is subject to formal review and approval as determined by its
contents or scope.
.paragraph
     A document subject to review and approval is handled as described in the
following paragraphs.
.paragraph
     Once cop each of the final draft is given to the appropriate programmer, the
appropriate programmer's manager, the Quality Assurance Analyst who
reviewed and cleared the corresponding software, and to any other person who
wishes to review the document. The writer attaches a traveller to the front of 
each copy. This traveller identifies and controls the document and asks for
approval, changes as necessary, and signature (see figure 2-2).
.paragraph
     These copies must be returned to the writer by the deadline shown on the
traveller. If a reviewer does not return his copy to the writer by the date requested,
his approval of the document as is will be assumed, unless the reviewer informs the
writer that he cannot meet the deadline for a valid reason.
his approval of the document as is will be assumed, unless the reviewer informs the
that he cannot meet the deadline for a valid reason.
.skip 1
2.5.400^&Proofreading\&
.paragraph
     The writer proofreads the reviewed draft for all non-technical errors. He also
proofreads any changes made by reviewers, incorporates any changes into the document,
and arranges for a joint review.
.skip 2
2.5.5  Joint Review\&
.paragraph
     The writer must review the document jointly with the original programmer to
resolve any conflicts which might arise from changes made in the document by
reviewers other than the original programmer. No changes other than those made 
during the joint review will be made to the document before it is published.
At completion of the joint review, the prepares the document for
master typing. This includes giving the secretary instructions written on the
inside front cover of the folder containing the document.
.skip 1
2.5.6  ^&Master Typing\&
.paragraph
     Once it has completed0steps described in the preceding paragraph, the
document is given to the secretary by the writer. The secretary prepares the 
document as a master in accordance with this guide and instructions given to her
by the writer.
.paragraph
     The completed master with the preceding draft is placedinside its
folder and returned to the writer for final proofreading.
.skip 2
2.5.7  ^&Final Proofreading\&
.paragraph
     The writer proofreads the master to ensure that nay corrections have been made
 and that it is ready for publication in all other respects. The writer gives a 
master ready for publication to the secretary for reproduction and distribution.
.skip 1
2.5.8  ^&Reproduction\&
.paragraph
     Masters of documents may be reproduced in one of two ways, depending on the
size and scope of the individual document.
.paragraph
     If xeroxing is the more economical way of reproducing a master, it will
be xeroxed by the secretary, otherwise it will be printed by an outside printer
using offset or some similar process.
.skip 2
2.5.9  ^&Distribution\&
.paragraph
     Documents will be distributed within the Technical Division by the secretary
as follows:
       Group Managers            - One copy each, accompanied by a
                                   notice that additional copies are
                                   available in the Technical Division
                                   Library for interested personnel
                                   under their jurisdiction.
.skip 1

2.6  DOCUMENT MODIFICATION
.skip 1
2.6.1  ^&General Requirements\&
.paragraph
     It is important to remember that modifications to documents do not always
result from modifications to software. That is, modifications can be made to a
program that would not change anything in the reference manual for that program;
hence, no document modification is necessary.
.paragraph
     There are two kinds of modifications: changes and new editions. These are
explained in the following paragraphs.
.skip 2
2.6.2  ^&Changes and New Editions\&
.paragraph
     A change is any addition, deletion, update or correction that affects only a
small portion of the document. Changes are issued via change packages. More than one
change can be issued via the same change package. A change package has one of two
forms, as follows:
.skip 1
       a. If the change to be made can be easily explained on a 
          cover sheet (figure 2-3), it is explained thereon and
          only the cover seet constitutes the change package.
.skip 1
       b. Any change other than as described in "a" above is shown
          on a copy of the actual page to be changed; this changed
          page and its accopanying cover sheet (figure 2-3) constitute
          the change package. If a changed page is0necessary , it
          must always be accompanied by a cover sheet.
.skip 1
.paragraph
     Annotate a changed page by a heavy vertical bar drawn in the right hand
margin opposite the line where the change appears. Retain the original page
to the original page number; for example, a spill-over page from original
page 2-13 would be numbered 2-13a. See figure 2-4.
.skip 1
.paragraph
     The writer must be informed as to what a change is each time it occurs.
Major changes should not be accumulated without being issued; however, numerous
minor changes can be accumulated over a very short period of time by either the
writer or by other personnel on a marked-up document, then issued by the writer all
together at one time.
.paragraph
     A new edition, as the term implies, is a complete republishing of the
entire document; it results when a substantial portion of a document needs
to be changed, or when a document which needs to e changed already has five
change packages issued against it.
of the entire document; it results when a
change affects a substantial portion of the document or when five
change packages have been issued against the original document. The original
document is understood to be the first edition, but is not labelled as such. The
first time it republished, show "Second Edition"
on the title page; the second time it is republished show "Third Edition", and
so on (see figure 2-5). A new 
edition incorporates all changes and is annotated as for a changed page. It is
 paginated as if it were a new document. A new edition completely replaces all others
preceding it.

DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS
.skip 2
3.1  INTRODUCTION
.paragraph
     This section contains guidelines for procedures and practices applicable
to all formal documentation such as manuals, handbooks, and user guides. These
procedures and practices should be followed when appropriate for other formal
documentation such as specifications and proposals.
.skip 2
3.2  SECURITY MARKINGS
.paragraph
     If any document is Company Confidential, it is so labelled in
capital letters on the front and back covers, centered one inch above the bottom
edge and one inch below the top edge, as shown in figure 3-1.
.skip 2
3.3  DOCUMENT PREPARATION
.SKIP 1
3.3.1  ^&Typing of Drafts and Masters\&
.paragraph
     If the draft is typed on a terminal, the secretary identifies the directory,
file and system for the document on the inside front cover of the manila folder
containing the original. All drafts produced on a terminal are printed
double-spaced.
.paragraph
     If the draft is produced on a typewriter, it is typed on bond at space-and-
one-half.
.paragraph
     If the draft of a document was typed on a terminal, the secretary produces
 a master by having the document printed single-spaced at an 
appropriate output device. Any corrections or changes to the document are made
during this final machine printing by the secretary using the EDITOR program
or a similar program. The completed machine printout is stripped, burst and 
collated0by0the secretary.
.paragraph
     If the draft of a document was typed on a typewriter, its master is also
typed on a typewriter. A master is yped at space-and-one-half on 8-1/2 by 11
 inch bond. A complete retyping to obtain a master is not mandatory. Instead, 
pages of the draft shoud be used as pages of the master if they are clean and need no
or only minor changes. For example, a page from a first draft which is changed
only in page numbering or which only needs one six-letter word replaced by another six-
letter word can be used as a master page.
.paragraph
     Some of the general rules a secretary should follow are:
.skip 1
       a. Unless a complete retype is obviously necessary, correction
            fluid, KO-REC-TYPE or mortising can be used to make changes
            on a draft or master.
.skip 1
       b. Do not exceed marginal limits.
.skip 1
       c. Do not hyphenate words at the end of a page.
.skip 1
       d. Do not type the last line of a paragraph by itself ("widow")
           at the top of a page; do not type the first line
           of a paragraph by itself at the bottom of a page.
.skip 1
       e. Do not type numerals at the end or beginning of a
           line in such a way as to separate them from 
          their associated nouns.
.skip 1
          EXAMPLES:
.skip 1
             ^&Wrong\&:  The .................shall be 15.5
                         feet long in accordance with part
                         3.5 of the specifi cation.
.skip 1
             ^&Right\&:  The .........shall be 15.5 feet long
                         in accordance with part 3.5 of the
                          specification.
.paragraph
     Pages of a manual or of any similar document that is length, should be laid out and
paginated as shown in figure 3-2. More details on layout and paging are contained
in the following paragraphs.
.skip 2
3.3.2  ^&Legibility\&
.paragraph
     Completed drafts already written by a person other than the 
writer must be legible; preferably they should be the original printout, listing
or handwritten pages. Drafts on continuous form paper must be stripped,
burst and loose leaf. Typed drafts must also be double spaced.
.skip 2
3.3.3  ^&Table of Contents and Index\&
.paragraph
     Every manual or similar document covered by this guide must have a table
of contents immediately following the title page. A table of contents for the
typical manual should follow the example in figure 3-3.
.paragraph
     If the nature of a document warrants an index, one will be created as
explained in paragraph 2.4.h. An index for the typical manual should follow
the example in figure 3-4.
.skip 2
3.3.4  ^&Command Forms\&
.pAragraph
     Commands or other entries to be made at a terminal must be printed
in upper case; they are underlined if not run in with text. Do not use quote marks
or any other marks to distinguish a command or entry. Place a command or entry
on a line by itself with out indention, unless the context of an individual
document makes it appropriate to be run in with text. Omit punctuation marks after
a command or other entry when the command or other entry appears on a line
by itself.
.paragraph
    Normally, a carriage return is understood to complete a command or entry
without being symbolized in text. A statement to this effect must appear at the
beginning of any document showing commands or terminal entries.
.paragraph
     The general form of a command contains a prompt, characters,
and underlining. Captialize the command wrds; metacharacters which represent
variable values are in lower case. Optional parts of the command are placed in
brackets. Braces are used to indicate that one of the enclosed options must be
chosen. For example:
.skip 1
_.^&PRINT [field list] [FOR condition]\&
.skip 1
                                                           T
-^&CREATE\& file name:description file name FROM   input file name\&
.paragraph
     In general forms of a language statement, no prompt, carriage return or
underlining is necessary. However, the same rules as in the preceding paragraphs
apply to capitalization, metacharacters, brackets, and braces. For example:
.skip 1
IF e THEN s   [ELSE s  ]
.skip 2
3.3.5  ^&Identification\&
.paragraph
     Every document must have certain identification o its first page. Reference
manuals and quick references use preprinted Technical Division forms displaying 
the Tymshare logo. User guides uaw rhw preprinted User Guide form also
displaying the Tymshare logo. A title page or User Guide form must show the title
or subject, month and year, and the computer system to which the document applies
(such as TYCOM IX or TYMCOM X).
.paragraph
     At an appropriate point near the beginning of every document, identify the
following as applicable;
.skip 1
       a. Any superseded, revised or supplemented publication or
          software.
.skip 1
       b. Any related publication or software.
.skip 2
3.3.6  ^&Pagination\&
.paragraph
     In documents that are printed on both sides of a sheet, the first pages of a 
table of contents, a section, an appendix and an index are always right-hand pages.
Page numbers of any right-hand page are placed one-half
inch below the top edge of the paper, with the page number ending at the right
margin. Page numbers of left-hand pages are also placed one-half inch below the 
top edge of the paper but they begin at the left margin.
.paragraph
     In documents that are printed on one side of a sheet only, the page
number will be placed as for a right-hand page. The page number consists of an
arabic number. In lengthy sectionalized documents page numbering should be

sectional (2-1, 4-15, B-3, etc.).
.paragraph
     Page numbers in an appendix consist of the capital letter of the appendix
followed by a hyphen and the number of the page within the appendix. For example,
page 3 of appendix B is page B-3.
.paragraph
     Pages of front matter are numbered with lower-case roman numerals (ii, iii,
iv, etc.). The title page shows no page number but is assumed to be page i.
Therefore, the page following the title page is page ii.
.paragraph
3.3.7  ^&Sections\&
.paragraph
     Text should be sectionalized into logical areas of discussion. The number and
content of the sections depends upon the nature of the document.
.paragraph
     Descriptive section headings are used to clearly identify what is tobe
discussed in the sections. Text within a section is confined to text properly
identified by the section heading. Each section is started on a new page. The
section number is as shown in figure 3-2. When the first page of a section consists
of a heading only, type the first line of the heading five lines below the top of the
paper.
.paragraph
     If a document is divided into sections, each with numerous
subheadings and sub-headings, each titled paragraph number consists of an arabic
number (which indicates the section of the document), a period, and a decimal
number that designates the sequence of the paragraph in the
section. (For example, 3.4 is the fourth paragraph in section 3; s.4.2 is the second
subparagraph within paragraph 3.4.
.paragraph
     Section subordination should be carried no further than the fourth
order (four decimal places). Any
subordination beyond fourth order should be eliminated by reorganizing
the material.
.skip 2
3.3.800^&Appendixes\&
.paragraph
     An appendix contains supplementary material that does not properly fit into the
body of the text. Do not use appendixes as "catch-all" devices for material that
should be included in the body of the text. An appendix follows the body of the text.
Typical subjects of appendixes are glossaries, lists of definitions, 
mathematical formulas.
.paragraph
     Appendix headings must clearly idetify the material contained in the appendix.
They follow the same format as for section headings, except that headings are
designated by captial letters (A, B, C, etc.). Paragraphs and subparagraphs are
numbered as in 4.3.5, except that the appendix letter designation is the first
part of the paragraph number (for example, B5 is the fifth paragraph of
appendix B). An appendix is preceded by a title page, table of contents, and lists
of figures and tables, if it is long or bound separately. A statement of scope is
unnecessary for an appendix preceded by the front matter just described.
.skip 2
3.3.9  ^&Figures\&
.paragraph
     A figure is a graphic representation, such as a control panel, word format or
block diagram.
.paragraph
     All figures in a document must be of such style and technique as 
to clearly, adequately, and economically portray the needed pictorial
support to the text. Use figures to do the following:
.skip 1
       a. Describe an item or idea if ths can be done more efficiently by
          graphic methods.
.skip 1
       b. Clarify text.
.skip 1
       c. Present phases difficult to describe by text alone.
.skip 1
       d. Call attention to details.
.paragraph
     Locate figures following the first reference to them in the text. Do not use
the same figure more than once in the same document. If possible, show a figure on one
sheet. If it is absolutely necessary to use more than one sheet show the sheet
number in parentheses following the title.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE:  Figure 5-3  System Flow Diagram (Sheet 1 of 2)
.skip 1
.paragraph
     Any text, other than legends or notes, which accompanies a figure is placed in
narrative form on a page of text and is followed as closely as possible by the figure.
.paragraph
     Whenever possible, place a figure vertically on a page so that both the figure
and its title can be read without rotating the page. If it is not practical to make a
figure vertical, orient it horizontally so the title and figure can be read when
the page is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Center a figure title below the figure
when the figure is in itsreading position. Capitalize only the 
major words in the title.
Make titles as short and concise as possible, yet be descriptive.
.paragraph
     Do not use foldouts (tip-ins) if they can be avoided. When used, foldouts
should0be no more than three times the single-sheet size (25-1/2 by 11 inches). Up to
50 percent reduction from elite type is permitted. Place titles for foldouts
below the figure on the last fold so they can be seen without unfolding the foldout.
.paragraph
     Number figures consecutively within each section by two-part arabic numbers.
Separate the two parts of the figure number by a hyphen. The first part of the number
designates the section number, the second part is the order within the section
(for example, figure 5-6 is the sixth figure in section 5).
.paragraph
     Number figures in appendixes with arabic numberals preceded  by the
capital letter of the appendix designation )for example, figure C-3 is the third
figure in appendix C).
.paragraph
3.3.10  ^&Tables\&
.paragraph
     A table is an arrangement of datain rows and columns, enclosed by 
horizontal and vertical lines.
.pragraph
     Reference data is normall presented in tabular form. If it lends itself better
to chart form, however, treat it as a figure (see paragraph 3.3.7). Some brief data
may be shown in table form without being enclosed by horizontal ansd vertical
lines. Any other type of data which lends itself to tabular presentation should also
be provided as a table.
.paragraph
.paragraph
     Tables must be designated and laid out so they may be easily understood. 
Locate them as near as possible to their first reference in the text. Small tables
should be on the same page as the text reference, if possible.
.paragraph
     Whenever possible, orient tables vertically so that both the table and its title
can be read without rotating the page. If a vertical table is not proactical, orient
the table  horizontally so the title and table can be read when the page is rotated
90 degrees clockwise. Table titles should be as short and cocise as possible, yet be
descriptive. Each title is centered above the table when the table is in its reading
position. Capitalize only the major words in the title. When a table consists of
more than one sheet, show the sheet number in parentheses following the
title, as for figures. Number tables in the same manner as for figures
(see paragraph 3.3.3).

.skip 2
3.3.11  ^&Lists and Enumerations\&
.paragraph
     Arrange all lists and enumerations in Technical Division documents as stacked
listings, not in continuous text form. Ideally, stacked listings should be
short phrases or dependent clauses. Extensive text of any importance does not belong
in a listing. A stacked listing must contain at least two items per category (for
example, if there is an entry for "a" there must also be an entry for "b"; if there
is a "1" there must also be a "2"). Identify stacked listings as follows, with
second and subsequent lines of an item beginning directly underthe first letter
of the first word in the item:

.skip 1
                               a.
                                  1.
                                     a)
                                        ^&1\&.
                                           ^&a\&.
.paragraph
     When a reference is made in the text to an item in a stacked listing, omit
the perid between numbers and letters, but retain parentheses and underlines.
For example:
.skip 1
               3.2a, 3.2a5, A6.11c, 4.8.2b1c)6)
.skip 2
3.3.12  ^&Abbreviations, Acronyms and Symbols\&
.paragraph
     Explain all abbreviations and acronyms in documents if they have meaningful
explanations and if they are not in common use by the Technical Division. If there
is only a small number of such abbreviatios or acronyms, they should be explained
in the narrative the first time they accur. If there is a large number of them, they
should be listed separately. If listed separately, they form the first appendix.
.paragraph
     Abbreviations and acronyms should be held to a minimum. At times, however,
they are useful in gaining conciseness where the same terms are used frequently 
throughout a document or section. Symbols are acceptable in figures and tables,
computer languages, computer commands and formulas, but in ordinary narrative. For
example
.skip 1
               3-phase, NOT 3 0; 19 percent, NOT 19%
.paragraph
     The general rule when an abbreviation or acronym is shown with its explanation
is: if the abbreviation or acronym is more frequently used than its explanation,
show the abbreviation or acronym first, followed by its explanation in parentheses;
if the explanation is more frequently used then show the explanation first, 
followed by its abbreviation or acronym.
.paragraph
     Once an abbreviation or acronym is explained, that abbreviation
or acronym should be used thereafter. For voluminous documents, the explanation
of an abbreviation or acronym should be repeated whenever necessary for clarity.
.paragraph
     Never abbreviate commands, unless the option to abbreviate commands in a
particular item of software needs to be illustrated.
.paragraph
     Abbreviations and acronyms in Technical Division documents are governed by
the following principles:
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES: the Britsih govt., BUT the U.S. Govt;
                  parts mfg. BUT Blank Parts Mfg. Co.
.paragraph
     Use abbreviations or acronyms in artwork if space is limited; otherwise, use
the spelled-out forms.
.parAGRAPH
     Almost invariably the same abbreviation or acronym is used for both singular
and plural forms. Howver, an acronym may be pluralized if the singular form might
cause misunderstanding.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES: 15 hr, NOT 15 hrs; 1 in. and 25 in.;
                  g for gravity and gravities;
                   BUT: CRTs, CPUs, DMTUs
.paragraph
     Abbreviated and nonabbreviated forms of the same term should not be mixed
indiscriminately. The term "input/output" is used in the following example:
.skip 1
       WRONG:  This I/O equipment operates with the older
                generation input/oupoput equipment.
.skip 1
       RIGHT:   This input/output equipment operates with
               the older generation input/output equipment.
.skip 1
                                  OR
.skip 1
                This input/output (I/O) equipment operates with
                the older generation I.O equipment.
.paragraph
     Where one of the terms is abbreviated, the entire expression should0be
abbreviated.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE:  vdc, NOT volts dc.
.paragraph
     Abbreviations of units of measure should be used only with numerals.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE:  3 min, NOT three min; 5 hr, NOT five hr.
.paragraph
     Spell out abbreviations for units of measure when used in
narrative. Abbreviate units of measure when used in figures, tables, charts or when
labelling, unless directed otherwise by this guide or individual Technical Division
requirements.
.paragraph
     Periods are omitted in abbreviations unless the bbreviated form spells a word
(ft for foot, BUT in. for inch) or unless omission  of the period would cause 
confusion. 
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES:  U.S., T.O., i.e., etc., and vol.
.paragraph
     
     When encountering forms of the cycles-per-second abbreviation (such as kc or
cps), change them to the internationally accepted Hertz which replaces cycles-per-
second.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES:  Use MHz for megacycles or MC; kHz for kiloxyxlesor
                   kc; Hz for cycles-per-second or cps.
.pargraph
     Avoid use of superscripts except in formulas and numerical expressions, or to 
show terminal characters. Use cu. in. rather than in.^3; but control ^D and
"a 200^8 bias" are acceptable.
.paragraph
     When abbreviations consisting of two or more words are used as modifiers, they
are not hyphenated.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES:  ac circuit, NOT a-c circuit; an ATE equipment,
                  NOT an A-T-E equipment.
.paragraph
     Do not leave spaces between letters or components of an abbreviation.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES:  R&D, NOT R & D; MUD, NOT M U D.
.paragraph
     Unless an abbreviation is given in a hyphentated form (ft-lb; ft-c), hyphens
should not be added when the words of the abbreviation become modifiers.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES:  va average, NOT v-a average.
                  built-in test equipment, BUT BITE.
                  lines-per-minute, BUT LPM.
.PARAGRAPH
     Avoid the use of symbols as abbreviations. DO NOT use the following:

     In specifications, the only symbols that should be used are degree of
temperature ( ) and the "+", "-", and " " to express ranges or tolerances.
.paragraph
     In any document covered by this guide, even where symbols occure as computer
commands or statements or other entries to be made at a terminal, spell out the
symbol whenever necessary to avoid ambiguity.
.paragraph
     Some terms are almost invariably given as abbreviations and are common enough
to require no prior spelling out. The following are representative examples
of abbreviations that need not be spelled out for the first time:
.skip 1
               Btu   (British termal unit)
                     (degrees of temperature)
               F      (Fahrenheit, when used with a numeral and degree 
                     symbol)
               etc.  (et cetera)
               g      gravity, when used as a unit of force)
               No.    (number, when used with a numeral)
               
.pARAGRAPH
     Avoid e.g. and i.e. .
.paragraph
     Spell out punctuation marks when they occur as text. This
includes asterisk and ampersand. It is permissible to place the symbol in 
parentheses after its name.
.skip 2
3.3.13  ^&Paragraphs\&
.paragraph
     Title paragraphs and subparagraphs as shown in figure 3-2. Each paragraph 
having a title also has a paragraph number. This number is consecutive
within each section. The numbered0segments of a section are always referred to as
paragraphs, never as sections or subsections. Paragraph subordination should be
carried no further than the fourth order (four decimal places). Any subordination
beyond fourth order should0be eliminated by restructuring the material.
.paragraph
     Indent text not run in with its paragraph number as shown in figure
3-2.
.paragraph
     List itemizations consisting of three or more items within a paragraph or
subparagraph by lower case letters and numbers as shown in figure 3-2.

.paragraph
     In all copy where meaning may be misunderstood, indicate all spaces with the
delta (  ) symbol. For example:

               "TAB    OUT"
                  (0-2)-PIC
.SKIP 2
3.3.15  ^&Definitions\&
.paragraph
     Each document will define all terms used therein which are not in common use by
the Technical Division. Unless there is a large number of such terms, they should be
defined in the narrative the first time they occur. If there is a large number of
definitions they should be listed separately. If listed separately, they form
Appendix B, unless there is no glossary of abbreviations and acronyms, in which
case a list of definitions will be Appendix A.
.skip 2
3.400pLURALS OR SPECIAL ENDINGS FOR ABBREVIATIONS, ACRONYMS, AND NUMBERALS
.paragraph
     In general, use abbreviations only in the singular form for nouns and in
present tense for verbs. Use the singular/present tense form to signify any of
the various derivatives of the root word (es, ed, er, al, ally, an, ance, ly, ing,
etc) as long as the meaning is clear.
.paragraph
     There are times, however, when understanding copy requires abbreviations,
acronyms, and logic forms to show special endings for clarity. In
constructing plural or verb forms of acronyms, capital letters, and logic functions,
add the s, ed, or ing without using an apostrophe; however, an exception is made
when the ending forms a word. To provide a basis for consisten handling of 
requirements for special endings, the following preferred forms are given:
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES: (AGC): AGCs, AGCed, AGCing
                  NAND: NANDs, NANDed, NANDing
                    OR: ORs, ORed, ORing
                     A: A's (an exception: forms a word without
                             apostrophe)
.skip 2
.paragraph
     Another exception to the use of an apostrophe with the
letter "s" to form plurals is found in forming plurals of numerals for symbols. In
this case, 2 becomes 2's; 10 becomes 10's; reference to a year becomes ..."in
the 1960's".
.paragraph
     Where lower case abbreviations require special endings to avoid misconception
of meaning, some of the letters are usually deleted from the added ending.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES:  atk: atkd
                   rd: rds
                  add: addl
                  sbm: sbming
                  asg: asgmt
.skip 2
3.5 CAPITALIZATION
.paragraph
     The general rule regarding capital letters in Technical Division documents
is: use capitals sparingly. Text with a preponderance of capital letters defeats
its purpose by diluting the value of captials.
its purpose by diluting the value of capitals.
.paragraph
     When software, systems, or procedures0have been identified by formal 
nomenclature, subsequent mention of their capitalized names does not communicate
information better or give additional information.
.paragraph
     For example, consider the following: "Digital Data Computer 
CP-901(V)/ASQ-224(V) is a general-purpose, stored-program computer. The computer
is able to communicate with numerous avionic subunits on 12 input
channels and 16 output channels". After equipment has been identified as the 
equipment being discussed  in the document, the reader will have no difficulty knowing
that subsequent uses of the word "computer" refere to the computer named in the
official nomenclature. Typing the word "computer" and its modifiers in initial
capitals will not enhance its meaning. In fact, a document abounding in capitalized
words is harder to read and abosrb.
.skip 2
3.5.1  ^&All-Capital-Letter Usage\&
.paragraph
     Use all-capital letters for the following:
.skip 1
       a. Section titles.

       j. Mnemonic designations (ITR, OFR).
       k. Actual computer commands (the CREATE command).
       l. Acronyms (TYMNET, TYMCOM, TYMSAT). Exceptions: Use lower case s
          for plurals in acronyms or where s may be interpreted as part of the
          abbreviation or acronym; for example, MODEMs.

       m. Directory, file program and subprogram names (*6NEWS, LOADER).
       n. Computer languages (QUICKTRAN, CObOL).

       o. Actual program statements, options, and clause names

          EXAMPLES: XYZ Data Transmission and Switching System, BUT
                    the data trasnmission system is...

       g. United States military services (like U.S. Army) and the
          word Government when it refers to the U.S.
          Government (BUT Italian government).

       h. Principal words of figure and table titles.

                    requirements of the Compute function...

       p. Date designations. When abbreviating a date, both terms
          should be shortened.

       q. The second and subsequent parts of a hyphenated term in titles and
          headings.
          EXAMPLES: Lock-On, All-Weather Equipment, BUT
                    Trade-offs were discussed.

       r. Terminal keys or functions.
          EXAMPLES: Carriage Return, Line Feed, Alt Mode/Secape,

       b. Reference designations (capacitor C25, tube V102).

       c. Tools, with or without part numbers (spanner wrench 101S-3).

       d. References to procedural steps (step a, run 2, phase 2, column 6).

       e. Paragraph, figure, table, and section designations )pAragraph
          3.1.2, figure 4-7, section 13).

       f. Words from which an acronym is made, unless the words are a

3.6  PUNCTUATION
.SKIP 1
3.6.1  ^&Comma\&
.paragraph
     The comma is used to clarify the meaning of a sentence. Use a comma:
.skip 1
       a. Between two independent clauses 
          connected by one of the coordinating conjunctions.
          EXAMPLE: The computer must be operating, but the operator
                    need not be present.

       b. Following an introductory adverbial clause or phrase preceding
          the main clause.
          EXAMPLE: At the end of this period, the computer will
                   transmit the data to the ECM Subsystem.

       c. Before the conjunction in a series of three or more items.
          EXAMPLE: The systems consist of compter, displays, and
                   interface equipment.

       d. Between a nonessential clause (for example, a
          parenthetical expression) and the remainder of the sentence.

       e. To indicate the omission of a word or words.
          EXAMPLE: The voltage was 15 volts; now, 10 volts.

       f. To separate numbers of five or more digits when not referring to
          actual terminal inpt or output.
          EXAMPLES: 10,000; 25,000; 4096; BUT 10000 or 25000 if referring
                    to actual terminal input or outpt; AND 4,096 if it is
                    part of a tabular listing with numbers of five or
                    more digits.

       g. After each of a series of coordinate qualifying words.
          EXAMPLE: Short, precise increments; BUT, bright red lamp.
                   (Note: Adjectives are coordinate if  (1) they can
                   be linked by "and" and (2) they independently
                   modify the substantive).


3.6.2  ^&Semicolon\&
.paragraph
     The semicolo is a separator of connected ideas. Use the semicolon to:
.skip 1
       a. Separate main clauses of a sentence, where it takes the place
          of the coordinating conjunction.
          EXAMPLE: The test series consisted of six vibration tests; 
                   the sixth test resulted in failure.

       b. Separate main clauses joned by a conjunctive adverb.
          EXAMPLE: The contract was completed; howver, considerable
                   work remained to be done.

       c. Separate a series of elements which themselves contain
          commas.
          EXAMPLE: The circuit consists of transistors, resistors, 
                   and capacitors; necessary interconnections; and
                   terminals.
.skip 2
3.6.3  ^&Colon\&
.paragraph
     The colon is properly used as a strong separator (almost equal to a
period) and as a formal introducer. In both usages, it calls attentio to
something that follows. Use the colon as follows:
.skip 1
       a. Between main clauses when the second clause explains the 
          first.
          EXAMPLE: There are two courses open to the programmers:
                   they can begin the modifications, or they can wait
                   for additional guidance.

       b. After an expression that formally introduces a list, an
          explanation, or a quotation.
          EXAMPLE: The systems contained the following items:
                   computers, displays, and typewriters.

                   The order had three types of components: diodes,
                   transistors, and capacitors.

       c. After a salutation (Dear Sir:); in expressing clock time
          (2:20 a.m.); in proportions (10:8:2).

       Do not use the colon to separate a preposition from its object(s).

       WRONG: Check for: broken wires, faulty connections, and
              defective cells.

       RIGHT: Check for the following: broken wires, faulty connectors,
              and defective  cells.

          OR: Check for broken wires, faulty connections, and
              defective cells.
.paragraph
     Captialize the first word after a colon only if the colon introduces a
coplete passage or sentence having an independent meaning. ("As the proverb
has it: He who hesitates is lost." "In summarizing, I want to state: The U.S.
has no choice but...").
.skip 2
3.6.4  ^&Hyphens and Dashes\&
.paragraph
     These marks of punctuation are often used (erroneuosly) as if they are
interchangeable. Each has a specific usage and form.
.skip 2
3.6.4.1  Hyphen
.paragraph
     The hyphen can be properly considered as the opposite of a comma. Where
the comma is used to separate two discrete elements, the hyphen is used to
link two or more elements which go together, as in a compound 
modifier.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES: The memory consists of 4096 32-bit words.
                 That is a well-written report.

            BUT: The memory consists of 4096 words of 32 bits.
                 The report is well written.

.paragraph
     In compounding modifiers, observe the rule that the words are
hyphenated only for clarity's sake. Some modifiers do not require hyphens.

.skip 1
       EXAMPLE: A long planned trip differs from a long-planned trip.

           BUT: Nuclear power station and nuclear-power station
                say the same thing, hence need no hyphen.
.paragraph
     In a series of adjective-noun words that have a common ending in ly and an
adjective or participle.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE: A two-, three-, or four-cell battery can be used.
.skip 1
       Do not use a hyphen between an adverb ending in ly and an adfective or
participle.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE: The hammer is a frequently used tool. 
                (Not frequently-used tool).

       Metacharacter words are not run together.

       EXAMPLE: file name; field list; expression list.
.skip 2
3.6.4.2  Dash
.paragraph
     When the dash must be used, it should appear as a hyphen with a
space on either side. Neither the dash nor the hyphen should be used to indicate a
range (as in 1-7). It should be replaced by "to" or "through". Don not used
dashes after stand-alone heads or in tabulations. Where a punctuation mark like
a dash seems required, use a colon, comma, or parentheses, as appropriate.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE:  Amperes: 60                    Amperes - 60
                   Volts: 120        NOT        Volts - 120
                 Current: ac                    Current - ac
.skip 2
3.6.5  ^&Slash Marks (or Solidus or Virgule)\&
.paragraph
     Use a slash mark, which is also called a solidus or virgule between two words
to indicate that either word or both words can apply to the case. In addition, use
the slash mark instead of a horizontal line in fractios and as a substitute for
"or" or "per" in certain cases.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES: and/or, recorder/reproducer, I/O,
                 3/4, GO/NO GO, pf/ft
.skip 2
3.6.3  ^&Parenthese\&
.paragraph
     Use parentheses to set off explanatory material (within a sentence or
paragraph) which is considered even more loosely connected to the subject matter
than nonessential clauses. When used within a sentence, no punctuation is needed
before the opening parenthesis; follow the closing parenthesis by any normal 
punctuation which would be used if the parenthetical expression were not present.
Where the parenthetical statement is an independent sentence (not within 
another sentence), place the period before the closing parenthesis. Where the
parenthetical material is at the end and is a portion of another sentence, the
period follows the closing parenthesis.
.skip 1
.skip 1
3.6.7  ^&Apostrophe\&
.paragraph
     Use the apostrophe to denote the possessive case of a noun or to indicate
the omission of a letter or letters in a contraction, Never use it to show
possession with the pronoun "it", since "it" then becomes the contraction of "it is".
In forming the possessive case of a singular noun ending in a letter other than "s"
or "z", place the apostrophe before the added s. In forming the possessive
case of a singular or plural noun ending in s or z, place the apostrophe after the s.
Do not use the apostrophe followed by an "s" with company or facility names to
indicate possession.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE: The Tymshare facility, NOT Tymshare's facility.
.skip 1
       Omit the apostrophe from abbreviations and acronyms.
.skip 
       EXAMPLES: addl, NOT add'l; MTBFs, NOT MTBF's
.skip 1
       But use the apostrophe to show plurals of numbers.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE: 1950's; 2 by 4's; 7's
.skip 2
3.6.8  ^&Quotation Marks\&
.paragraph
     Use quotation marks in their usual manner to quote material taken from
another source. When several paragraphs are quoted, repeat quotation marks at the
beginning of each paragraph so cited, but place closing quotation marks at the end
of the last paragraph only. A second use frequently made of quotation marks is to 
pont up a word or phrase that is used in a separate or special sense.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE: The job was handled on a "first come, first served"
                  basis.
.paragraph
     Where a quotation is used at the end of a sentence, place the period after the
closing quotation mark. Place a comma also, if required by construction, outside
quotation marks. Place other marks of punctuation, unless they are part of
the quotation itself, after the closing quotation marks.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE: It bore the words "handle with care".
                It was labelled "repro", but was a rough draft.
                Did he mean "effect" or "affect"?
.skip 2
3.6.9  ^&Numerals\&
.paragraph
     Generally, do not use the word "number" or its abbreviation before digits when
referring to a model, a document, or similar item.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES: Model 560, NOT Model No. 560
                 Specification SK110124, NOT Specification No. SK110124
                 Figure 6-5, NOT Figure No. 6-5

.skip 1
       Spell out one-digit numbers and the number ten, unless:
.skip 1
       a. The numbers relate to units of measurement, time, or money.
          EXAMPLES: 3 sq mi, 1 mv, 5 rpm, 6-1/2 hours, 1:20 p.m.,
                    8 dollars or $3 million, 6 percent, BUT three
                    computers, five pages, one-quarter red and
                    three-quarters green, five and a half pages.

       b. The numbers reflect matthematical usage.
          EXAMPLE: 2 to 1 ratio; multiplied by 2
.paragraph
     At the beginning of a sentence, spell out all numbers; hyphenate compound
numbers when spelled out and treated as unit modifiers.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES: Ten capacitors are used. BUT use 10 capacitors.
                 Thirty-four message units were used. BUT They
                 used 34 message units.
.paragraph
     Where a combination of one-digit and several-digit numbers are used in the same
sentence, maintain the rule of witing out one-digit numbers unless the list
contains many related items in a series, in which case, use all
numerals.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES: The document has two sections three appendixes,
                 and 45 pages, yet can be read in 9 minutes.

           BUT: The equipment consists of 6 motors, 3 cases, 
                15 cabinets, 8 diodes and 1 van.
.paragraph
     Do not use a number that contains more than six traling zeros within
text.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES: $5 billion, NOT $5,000,000,000
                 2.6 million switch actuations, NOT 2,600,000
                 switch actuations.
.paragraph
     Write numbers from 1000 to 9999 without a comma; a five-digit (or larger)
number requires a comma (10,501). Where four- and five-digit (or larger) numbers
are used in a tabular listing, however, the four-digit number also requires a comma.
Write numbers representing actual terminal input or outpt without commas.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES:   ^&Tabular Listing\&           ^&Terminal\&

.skip 1

.paragraph
     Wxcept for actual terminal input or output, when stating a decimal fraction
place a zero before the decimal point.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE:       0.25; 0.0015; BUT .25 and .0015 for
                      actual terminal input or output.
.paragraph
     In columns of figures, when decimal fractions are used with whole numbers,
add decimals and zeros to the whole numbers to balance the columns.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES:               25.0
                                  0.2
                                  1.6
                                  4.0
                                  3.8
                                153.5
.paragraph
     Give arabic numbers to common fractions followed by measurement 
units. When used by themselves, write out fractins.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES: 2/3 fl. oz, BUT two-thirds of the document.
.paragraph
     Spell out numbers of less than 100 that precede unit modifiers haveing a
numeral as the first element of the unit modifier.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES:  fifteen 2-cm lengths; eighty-four 3-inch-diameter
                  holes

            BUT:  537 10-ohm readings
.skip 1
       Do not repeat in parentheses a number that has been written out first.
.skip 1
       WRONG:  Five (5) of the pages were missing.

       RIGHT:  Five of the pages were missing.
.paragraph
     In stating numerals as dates, the international system of stating the day first,
month next, and year last is preferred.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES:  12 May 1968, or June 1968, NOT May 12, 1968
.skip 1
       Generally, arabic numbers are preferable to roman numbers.
.skip 2
3.6.10  ^&Footnotes and Reference Callouts\&
.paragraph
     When a parenthetical statement is needed to explain something within the text,
or to give credit for quoted matter, use a footnote. This avoids breaking 
continuity of the copy. Footnotes should be kept to a
minimum. If more than three appear on a page, restructure the text.
.paragraph
     Callouts of footnotes in text or in illustrations appear as superscript arabic
numerals in parentheses, with any required punctuation preceding the callout.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE:  Three computers (1) operating in tandem are used.
.paragraph
     The footnote at the bottom of the page should not end with a period,
nor should the footnote number be set off by parentheses.
.skip 1
       TEXT EXAMPLE:  Xxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxx (1) xxxxxxxxxxx xxx x xxxxxx.
       BOTTOM OF PAGE EXAMPLE:
                                 1 Xxxxxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxx
.paragraph
     When referring in text to an item in a document's reference list, spell out
the word "reference".
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE:        ....found in reference 6.
.skip 2
3.6.11  ^&Notes, Cautions, and Warnings\&
.paragraph
     Notes, cautions, and warnings precede the text to which each applies. They do not 
contain precedural steps nor are they numbered. They will be short and 
concise and be used to emphasize important or critical instructions. Conditions for use are
as follows:
.skip 1
       a. NOTE:                An operating procedure, condition etc., which
                               it is essential to highlight.
.skip 1
       b. CAUTION:             Operating procedures, practices, etc., which if
                               not strictly observed, will result in damage to
                               software or hardware.
.skip 1
       c. WARNING:             Operating procedures, practices, etc., which
                               will result in destruction of software or
                               hardware.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE: NOTE: Tye the word "NOTE", "CAUTION" or "WARNING"
                in all caps and place it to the left of the body of
                the note, caution, or warning. Type the body single
                space and indent it an equal distance from both margins.
.skip 2
3.6.12  ^&Mathematical Copy and Artwork\&
.paragraph
     Care must be exercised with mathematical copy or art, especially if the rough copy
is handwritten, to ensure proper placement of such items as subscripts and superscripts.
Take special care to distinguish the main lne of an equation fro the 
numerators and denominators of fractions.
.paragraph
     Treat words used to introduce an equatin the same as any other words
forming a sentence.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE:  Equating the significant terms leading to
                 XYZ equiibrium gives
.skip 1
                               X  = Y  Z  X 
.paragraph
     Note that no punctuation follows the word "gives", since none would be used in a
standard sentence. Where standard usages of punctuatin apply, however, use punctuation.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE:  For an alternate case,
.skip 1
                               X = Y  Z  X
.paragraph
     In editing handwritten copy for equations or illustrations, unless the copy
clearly indicates subscripts, superscripts, and Greek letters, use editing marks.
Asl shown in appendix A, note subscripts by the ( ) and superscrips by ( ). calrify
Greek letters by notations in the margin.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE:                EX  RTN=XYZ
.paragraph
     Remember that in equations, odd marks may have a meaning, so delete nothing if
you are not sure of the intent. For example, 5! may look strange, but it
means 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1.
.paragraph
     As a ready reference, upper case, lower case, and handwritten Greek letters
are presented in appendix B.
.skip 2
3.6.13  ^&Stacked (Vertical) Listings\&
.paragraph
     In listings, follow headings within the stacked lstings by periods
or colons. Particularly avoid use of dashes, since dashes might be misinterpreted as
minus signs when used with numbers.
.skip 1
       WRONG:  a. Output  voltage - 0 to 60 volts peak.
               b. Tolerance - 10 inches
               c. temperature - 15
               d. Load - 100 pf

       RIGHT:  a. Output voltage: 0 to 60 volts peak
               b. Tolerance: 10 inches
               c. Temperature: 15
               d. Load: 100 pf
.skip 2
3.6.14  ^&Ellipses\&
.paragraph
     Ellipsis marks are three periods which indicate omission of one or more words
not essential to the immediate purpose.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLE: ...require knowledge of...transistors and
                capacitors...It also requires...writing skill.
.paragraph
     To mark omission of an entire paragraph or large blocks of text, insert a full
line of periods but be sure the periods do not extend beyond the longest  typed line of
the page.
,skip 2
3.6.15  ^&Compounding/Solid Forms\&
.paragraph
     When using unit modifiers, there are times when a choice has to be made between 
open or hyphenated compounds. In the interests of consistency, the following guidance
is given for methods of handling compounding.
.paragraph
     In compounding, use hyphens sparingly to help clarify the 
meaning for the reader. Compounding hyphens belong in (1) a phrase that can be
interpreted one way when it is hyphenated and another way when unhyphenated, (2) the
combining of two or more words into a single unit modifier
(or noun) for quicker assimilation of the meaning, and (3) the separating of a word
from its prefix (or two words) to prevent a confusing succession of letters.
.skip 1
     (1) a long planned trip; a long-planned trip.
         a little explored territory; a little-explored territory
.skip 1
     (2) an up-to-date configuration; a pulses-per-second meter
.skip 1
     (3) a re-covered chair; a recovered chair
         un-ionized; bell-like; anti-isolationist
.paragraph
     Where hyphens are used (in text) for all of the compound modifiers (whether the
hyphens are necessary for clarity0or not), they can give the text a "busy" patchwork
-quilt appearance. Therefore, do not hyphenate compound modifiers that are short and
easily understood.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES:  wideband, update, cutoff, mockup
.paragraph
     Appendix C gives compounding guidance on a list of words that are used frequently.
.skip 2
3.7   LANGUAGE STYLE
.paragraph
     Write documents in language free of vague and ambiguous terms, using the
implest words and phrases that will convey the intended meaning. Inclusion of
essential information should be complete, whether by direct statements
or by reference to other documents. Consistency in terminology and organization of
material will contribute to the clarity and usefulness of the document.
Sentences should be as short and concise as possible, and punctuation should aid in reading 
and prevent misreading. Well planned word order
requires a minimum of punctuation. When extensive punctuation is necessary for clarity, 
the sentence(s) should be rewritten.
.paragraph
     Rewrite sentences with compound clauses to make short and concise
separate sentences. Although profuse capitalization of words is avoided in most
documents, in specifications treat the major items of equipment
(where the item is the subject of the  specification) like proper
nouns and initial-cap them.
.skip 2
3.7.1  ^&Spelling, Capitalization and Industry Standards\&
.paragraph
     As a general guide, use the United States Government Printing
Office (GPO) Style Manual as a guide to capitalization, spelling, punctuation,
syllabication, etc. Use the latest edition of Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary
when the GPO Style Manual does not provide the required guidance.
.paragraph
     For computer-industry terminology, and when neither of the two preceding 
standards provide required guidance, use the latest edition of Vocabulary for
Information Processing (ANSI X3.12) published by the American  Natinal Standards
Institute, or the latest edition of the Computer Dictionary and Handbook by Charles
Sippl, in that order.
.skip 2
3.7.2  ^&Abbreviatios and Acronyms\&
.paragraph
     Use those abbreviations and acronyms which are prevailing and established at
Tymshare. If Tymshare produces a glossary of abbreviations and acronyms that glossary
should be followed. If there is no prevailing or established usage at Tymshare for
a particular item, or if there is no Tymshare glossary covering an abbreviation in
question, use the standards mentined in the preceding paragraph, 3.7.1, in the
order mentioned.
.skip 2
3.7.3  ^&Proprietary Names\&
.paragraph
     In specifications, do not use trade names, copyrighted names, or other
proprietary names applying exclusively to the product of one company unless the
item(s) cannot be adequately described because of the technical involvement,
construction, or composition. In other documents, do not use trade names, copyrighted
names or other proprietary names where a generic term could apply as well.
.skip 2
3.7.400^&Commonly Used Words and Phrases\&
.paragraph
     Certain words and phrases are frequently used in a document. The following
rules give guidance for preferred usage:
.skip 1
     a. Cite referenced documents thus: "In accordance with...";
        "conforming to..."; "as specified in...".

     b. Use "unless otherwise specified" to indicate an alternative
        course of action. Always use this prase at the beginning of the
        sentence, and if possible, at the beginning of the paragraph. Use
        this phrase only when it is possible to clarify its meaing by
        providing a reference (such as in another section of the document)
        for further clarification.
.skip 1
     c. When referring to a requirement in the document and the
        requirement referenced is rather obvious or not difficult to
        locate, use the phrase "as specified herein".
.skip 1
     d. Use the phrase "...to determine compliance with..." in place of
        "...to determine compliance to...".
.skip 1
     e. In  stating limitations in specifications, state the phrase thus:
        "The diameter will be not greater than...".
.skip 1
     f. Capitalize the words "drawing", "bulletin", etc., only when they are
        used immediately preceding the number of a document. However,
        identify specifications, standards, and handbooks in a document only
        by their symbol and number (...contained in MIL-E-000; NOT 
        ...contained in specification MIL-E-000).
.skip 1
     g. Refer to the terminal, not the teletype.
.skip 1
     h. Do not use computer jargon or mathematical jargon unnecessarily.
.skip 1
     i. Use enter, type, and print; NOT enter in, type in or print out.
        "Type" refers to an entry made by a user at at terminal; "print"
        refers to output sent to a terminal or printer by software or
        hardware.
.skip 1
     j. Input, output, and reference are not verbs.
.skip 1
     k. Use "enable" only to mean restoration of a suppressed interrupt
        feature or to convey a related meaning in the context of a
        computer program feature; never use it to mean "allow", "make"
        possible" or "permit".
.skip 1
     l. Avoid redundant modifiers and the definite article when
        using abbreviations, acronyms, software names and computer
        functios in a sentence. the following examples illustrate
        preferred usage:
.skip 1
        WRONG: The EDITOR language provides...
               ...depending on the NASA requirements.
.skip 1
        RIGHT: EDITOR provides...
               ...depending on NASA requirements.
.skip 2
3.7.5  ^&Use of "Will", "Should", and "May" in Specifications\&
.paragraph
     Use "will" to describe software; program purposes, functios and capabilities,
routines, systems, displays, input and output, parameters and constraints. This
includes quoting or copying descriptions from any other Tymshare specification. This
also includes operator and personnel instructions.
.paragraph
     Use "will" or present tense indicative mood to describe hardware; hardware
purposes, functions and capabilities, routines, systems, parameters, and constraints.
.paragraph
     Use "shoud" and "may" whenever it is necessary to express non-mandatory
provisions.
.skip 2
3.7.6  ^&Use of "And/Or"\&
.paragraph
     Avoid the term "and/or" in documentation. In specifications especially, where
definitive, precise language is imperative, the prase "and/or" has no place.
.skip 2
3.7.7  ^&Use of "Not Applicable" and "None" in specifications
.paragraph
     Where an entire section, an entire paragraph, or a listed item is not
applicable to a document, show the heading, but use "Not applicable" or "None"
instead of such phrases as "Does not apply" or "There are no XYZ requirements".
.skip 2
3.7.8  ^&Underlining\&
.paragraph
     Do not underline any portion of a paragraph or capitalize phrases or words
for the sake of emphasis. All information is important.
.paragraph
     Underline computer commands, statements and other entries
to be made at a terminal if they appear on a line alone.
.skip 2
3.7.9  ^&Footnotes\&
.paragraph
     Footnotes convey additional information that is not properly a part of the
text. They should be used sparingly. If used, they are marked by arabic numerals,
which are placed at the end of the word or phrase to which they refer. Place the
footnote to which the numeral refers at the bottom of the page. The following is an
example of a footnote used in a document.
.skip 1
       TEXT EXAMPLE:  ...xxxxxxxxxx xxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx (1) xx xxxxxxxxxxxx

.SKIP 1
       BOTTOM OF PAGE EXAMPLE: (1) Xxxxxxxxxxxxx xx xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxx
.paragraph
     Place footnotes to a table or illustration below the table or illustration.
Designate footnotes separately for each table.
.skip 2
3.7.10  ^&Definitions\&
.paragraph
     The inclusion of a definition can be avoided0if requirements are properly stated. 
When the meanings of only a few terms must be established in the document,
definitions can be placed in the text. However, it is often clearer to
list a large number of definitions in a separate section of the document,
especially where the terms are used in many places throughout the document.
When this is done, refer to the existence of a definition in a parenthetical phrase.
See additional guidelines in paragraph 3.3.15.
.skip 2
3.7.11  ^&Cross References (Internal)\&
.paragraph
     Structure material to avoid cross
references (references to parts within a document). If cross references are
absolutely necessary, hold them to a minimum. Use cross references only to clarify
the relationship of requirements within the document and to avoid
inconsistencies and unnecessary repetition. When the cross reference is to a
be only to the specific paragraph number. When making the reference, write "paragraph
x.x.x" even though the referenced portion may be a subparagraph. When making an
internal reference to a heading number or paragraph number, omit the period between
letters and numbers.
.skip 1
       EXAMPLES:  3.3a1, 2.12.1, A26c
.skip 2
3.7.12  ^&References to Other Documents\&
.paragraph     
     Referencing is the approved method for including information in documents where
this eliminates repetition of information that is adequately covered
elsewhere. Chain referencing is restricted to other documents that are specifically
and clearly applicable  to the document, are current, and are available. Care must be
taken in writing the document to indicate the extent to which each referenced
document is applicable. Wherereference is made to aparagraph of anexternal document,
the reference should cite the title , and document number if any, in that
order; for example, "in DEC User's Handbook 10574".
.skip 2
3.7.13  ^&Limitation of References\&
.paragraph
     A document should not contain anything in conflict with provisions in 
referenced documents unless it is desirable to make special exceptions to such
provisions, in which case the specific provision to which exception si made  must be
stipulated. Other documents should not be made a part
of a document by reference unless the items, procedures, or other material
in the referenced documents cannot be logically included in the document being 
written. Do not refer to the whole of a referened document unless all of 
its provisions are clearly required.
.skip 2
3.7.14  ^&Person, Voice and Tense\&
.paragraph
     In manuals and similar documents, use the imperative mood, present tense,
active voice form of verb; for example, "Find the first zero"; "Type GO after a
prompt".
.paragraph
     In specifications, use the present tense indicative form of verb; for
example, "A compile will be made"; "GO will be typed".
.skip 2
3.7.15  ^&Slang and Colloquialisms^&
.paragraph
     Slang and colloquialisms have no place in documentatio that is technical ,
formal and professional.
.skip 1
       POOR:   A bug in one node clobbers another node.
.skip 1
     BETTER:   A bug in one node alters another node.
.paragraph
    Never con a verb from a noun . For example, the phrase "An open
file was CARMELLed by the RUN command" must be rewritten to avoid using the
program name, CARMEL, as a verb.
