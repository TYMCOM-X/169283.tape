Apr, 1973


COPYRIGHT 1973, DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP., MAYNARD, MASS.





1.0 SUMMARY

     The reasons for this release are:-
a) To provide support for FORTRAN-10
b) To provide support for LINK-10
c) To fix outstanding bugs.

     COMPIL version  22  is  version  21A  with  edits  #110
through   #143   inclusive.    This   version   has  no  new
deficiencies and fully replaces version 21A.

     COMPIL is documented in the software notebook vol.  #1.
Section, DECsystem-10 OPERATING SYSTEM COMMANDS

     It is suggested that version 22  be  used  as  soon  as
possible  to accustom users to the new switches and features
before the release of FORTRAN-10 and LINK-10.

     Because of extra disk accesses this version  of  COMPIL
will be slightly slower than previous versions, however this
effect has not been noticable in house.

2.0 EXTERNAL CHANGES

  #110  DMN
        Add switches /F40 and /F10 for F40 old compiler  and
        new  FORTRAN-10 compiler.  These switches are either
        permanent or temporary just like /LIST, however they
        only apply to fortran programs.
        In addition recognise two  fortran  extensions,  .F4
        and .FOR
        COMPIL will read existing fortran  binary  files  to
        see  if  they were compiled by the required compiler
        (second word of title block), and if  not,  force  a
        recompilation.
        Note, it is  not  possible  to  load  both  F40  and
        FORTRAN-10 produced binary files together, therefore
        if loading or execution is required either  /F40  or
        /F10 should be a permanent switch.
        The assembly control switch  is  DFORTRAN  which  is
        zero for F40 and one for FORTRAN-10.
        The default case is /F40.

  #111  DMN
        Add switches /LOADER and /LINK to use either  LOADER
        or  LINK-10  for  LOAD,  EXECUTE, or DEBUG commands.
        One of these switches must be  given  early  in  the
        command  string  as COMPIL may have to generate load
        control switches.
        The assembly control switch is LINK10 which is  zero
        for LOADER and one for LINK-10.
        The default value is /LOADER.
        The LOADER temp file is xxxLOA whereas the  one  for
        LINK-10 is xxxLNK

  #113  SPR 9343
        SYS:FILE.REL/REL command fails
        Source file in same command but after above fails.
        Diagnosis: Flags do not get  cleared  correctly  and
        SYS: never gets stored.
        Fix: set LOKNAM if switch /REL given,  clear  LOKNAM
        and FL2 at scan for next file.

  #114  SPR 9343
        If temp file is greater than  128  words,  the  last
        character is lost.
        Diagnosis: Buffer count is off by one.
        Fix: Make it one less.

  #116  DMN
        Since FORTRAN-10 generates different code  for  KA10
        and  KI10,  add  two new switches /KA10 and /KI10 to
        allow  the  user  to  specify  the  target  machine.
        COMPIL  reads  the  existing fortran binary files to
        determine if recompilation is required.

        The effect of #110 and #116 is to  ensure  that  all
        fortran  programs  execute  with  either compiler on
        either machine with the minimum of user confusion.

  #123  DMN
        If a PIP TMPCOR file exists, commands such as
        DEL @xxxPIP, fail.
        Problem is that COMPIL tries to  read  a  file  from
        TMPCOR  using the rightmost 3 characters of the file
        name.  Normally this loses  and  COMPIL  then  tries
        DSK.   However  in the case of file xxxPIP where xxx
        is not the job number COMPIL  reads  the  temp  file
        rather than the DSK.
        Fix: if the leftmost 3 characters of the  file  name
        do not match the job number do not read TMPCOR.

  #124  DMN
        Add LINK-10 switches as quoted strings as in
        %'HASHSIZE:7000' %"MAXCOR:45K"
        The quote character can be any alphanumeric and most
        but  not  all other characters.  The recomended ones
        are single and double quote, characters not  allowed
        are "@" and ";".
        Note, see also #135

  #124  DMN
        Add switch /SEARCH, this  is  exactly  the  same  as
        /LIBRARY but is more consistent with LINK-10.

  #131  SPR 9676
        COPY gives command error if a PIP switch  is  passed
        on  the  input side when no file name is given (i.e.
        PTR:).
        Fix bug, and at same time allow PIP switches  to  be
        passed  as  /X  where  X  is any single alphanumeric
        character.

  #132  SPR 9589
        There are several bugs in the LABEL command, most of
        them are user errors which COMPIL does not correctly
        handle.
        Fix, test  for  missing  label  delimiter  and  give
        syntax error.
        If device is missing give message :-
        ?EXPLICIT DEVICE REQUIRED
        Also allow @ sign to be part of a  label  name  (but
        not a delimiter).

  #133  BBN
        Add feature test  switch  TENEX  which  if  non-zero
        assembles  code  to  run  under TENEX monitor.  This
        switch is zero in the DEC version.
        As part of same  edit  (but  not  under  TENEX)  add

        recognition of LOADER switches of form:-
        %&GLOBAL&SWITCH  which  passes  /&GLOBAL&SWITCH   to
        LOADER.   This  is  for  the non-standard version of
        LOADER which recognizes defined  global  values  for
        some switches.

  #135  DMN
        As a conversion aid, if LINK-10 is to be used  check
        the  switch  delimiter and give a warning message if
        it is alphanumeric (0-9 ,A-Z, a-z) or - or &.
        The message is
        %Illegal switch delimeter: X
        This is not fatal, but if LOADER switches are  being
        passed, will generally result in a command error.

  #143  DMN
        Add two new switches /OPTIMIZE and /NOPTIMIZE  which
        pass the corresponding switches to FORTRAN-10.
        Also allow  FORTRAN-10  switches  to  be  passed  in
        parentheses  as  (SWITCH1  SWITCH2  SWITCH3,,) where
        each switch is separated by a space.

3.0 KNOWN BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES

        No known bugs or deficiencies are in version 22

4.0 CHANGES IN INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

        The installation guide is COMPIL.CTL.
        There are no changes in installation instructions.

5.0 INTERNAL CHANGES

  #112  SPR 9343
        There is not enough space for LOADER switches.
        Fix: Increase LODSCT to 40 characters.

  #115  DMN
        The editor used for CREATE and EDIT is not symbolic,
        so  COMPIL  must  be  edited to change from LINED to
        EDITS.
        Fix:  Add  assembly  symbol  EDITOR  which  has  the
        default value of SIXBIT/LINED/.

  #117  SPR 8768
        Output devices for  binary  and  listing  files  are
        ignored.
        Diagnosis: No code to handle them.
        Fix: Add some preliminary code to at least save  the
        output device name.
        Note, this does not  solve  the  problem,  which  is
        complex,  but  is  at  least  a  start  in the right
        direction.

  #120  DMN
        Fix bugs in FORTRAN-10 code.

        DEB FILE.CBL fails when going to LINK-10.
        Fix, add a space after /E/L

  #127  DMN
        FORTRAN-10  uses  SCAN  which  does  not   recognize
        LOADER! construction for RUN UUO.
        Fix, pass /RUN:LOADER or /RUN:LINK  if  compiler  is
        FORTRAN-10.

  #130  DMN
        Ill  mem  refs  etc.   while  compiling  F4   files.

        running.

  #142  SPR 8215
        Null extensions (period only) causes problems.
