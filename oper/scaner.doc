FROM: JON SHEPHERD

SUBJECT:  THE SCANER PROCEDURES.
********************************

I HAVE RECENTLY COMPLETED WORK ON A NUMBER OF STANDARD PROCEDURES TO
ENABLE SIMPL PROGRAMMERS TO  WRITE THE INTERFACE PART OF ANY PROGRAM.
SPECIFICALLY THESE PROCEDURES HAVE THE FOLLOWING FEATURES;

1) THE ABILITY TO USE A PRE-DEFINED KEYWORD LANGUAGE AT RUN TIME.

2) THE ABILITY TO INPUT AND OUTPUT FLOATING POINT NUMBERS IN REGULAR
   OR COMMERCIAL FLAVORS.

3) THE ABILITY TO PRE-DEFINE, RECOGNIZE AND EXECUTE STANDARD FRONT END
   COMMANDS.

4) THEY CONTAIN THE BASIC TOOLS TO PARSE ANY INPUT LINE NO MATTER
   HOW COMPLEX.

THE ROUTINES ARE STORED TOGETHER IN A FILE CALLED SCANER AND WILL
BE REFERED TO AS SCANER BELOW.



1. INTRODUCTION
***************

THE USE OF SCANER CAN BE BROKEN INTO 5 DESCRETE STEPS AND I SHALL
DOCUMENT THESE STEPS IN ORDER.

FIRST IS THE PREPARATION OF THE KEYWORD LANGUAGE FILE. THE KEYWORD
LANGUAGE IS USED TO SPECIFY TO THE PROGRAM, WORDS OR PHRASES THAT
THE CUSTOMER WILL USE TO PERFORM CERTAIN TASKS. FOR EXAMPLE THE
STANDARD FRONT END IS PART OF THE KEYWORD LANGUAGE (ALTHOUGH IT 
IS GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY AND NEED NOT BE SPECIFIED BY THE PROGRAMMER)
AND SO ARE COMMANDS SUCH AS: LIST, RUN, SAVE ETC. THE KEYWORD
LANGUAGE IS FULLY EXPLAINED BELOW.

SECOND IS THE RUNNING OF THE PROGRAM SCCONV WHICH TRANSFORMS THE
KEYWORD LANGUAGE FROM HUMAN TO PROGRAM ORIENTATION.

THIRD IS THE PREPARATION OF THE INFORMATION FILE WHICH CONTAINS
DETAILS OF THE STANDARD FRONT END SUCH AS THE VERSION NUMBER,
HELP, CAPABILITIES AND INSTRUCTIONS TEXT ETC.

FOURTH IS THE INITIAL RUNNING OF THE PROGRAM AND THE SUBSEQUENT SAVE.

AND LAST IS THE USE OF SCANER WITHIN A RUNNING PROGRAM.
