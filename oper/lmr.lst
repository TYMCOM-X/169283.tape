          Commands will be constructed of elements which can be
          combined to form a command to the program.  The elements and
          command structure is described below:

          NOTE: LINE FEEDS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A VALID
                CHARACTER, THEY WILL BE IGNORED AND USED FOR COMMAND
                CONTINUATION.


          DIRECTIVE      This element of the command tells LMR what
                         type of operation is to be performed.


          OBJECTIVE      This element of the command tells LMR on
                         which objective to perform the directive.
                         This might be a program name, a system
                         number, a program classification or the word
                         ALL.


          DEVICE         This element of the command tells LMR the
                         output device if output is to be directed to
                         some device other than would normally be used
                         for the directive referenced.


          /switch        This element of the command tells LMR what
                         special options are to be used in performing
                         the directive referenced.


          A command will be constucted of the above elements in the
          following format:

                         Whether or not any software tests are in
                         progress on that system


          INITIALIZE     This directive will initialize LMR and will
                         establish auxillary circuits to all other
                         available TYMCOM X systems.  It will also
                         read all data into memory including the
                         scheduling information.  If this directive is
                         executed first, the operation of all other
                         directives requiring this information will be
                         enhanced since no checking will be required
                         by the other directives to determine if the
                         data is available.


          READ           This directive will read the data and
                         scheduler information into memory.  This
                         directive is provided if the user makes
                         changes to the data and does not want it
                         saved.


          WRITE          This directive will force the data currently
                         in memory to be saved.  This includes the
                         data for the system and also the scheduler if
                         that information is currently in memory.


          BACKUP         This directive is provided to give the user
                         the ability to save a backup copy of the
                         current data and scheduler.


          DEVICE         This directive will set a default device to
                         replace the normal output device in all
                         commands which permit this option.  It may be
                         considered to be the setting of a global
                         device.  It may overridden by setting a
                         device in any command given to LMR.


          SWITCHES       This directive will allow the user to set
                         global switches which affect all commands
                         where such a switch could normally be used.
                         The global switches can be overridden by the
                         use of a contradictory switch in any command
                         given to LMR.

          SCAN           This directive will instruct LMR to scan a
                         program, classification of programs, or
                         related programs selected as the objective
                         and will perform the functions described
                         below depending on the switches set.  The
                         directive may be modified to correct all
                         problems found or to just report the
                         problems.  The default conditions will be to
                         scan all programs under the maintenance of
                         LMR and to correct any errors located.  The
                         output will normally be directed to line
                         printer if one is available or to a file
                         specified by the user.

                         that the user has.


          SET LICENSE    This directive will allow the user to change
                         the license he currently has.  If it is an
                         increase in his license, it will ask for
                         verification by name and password, but if it
                         is a reduction in license, it will merely
                         reduce to the license requested.


          VERIFY         This directive will verify that everything
                         about LMR is correct and that it will run

                         correctly.  This will include the program,
                         its data, the SCHEDULER, and its status.  It
                         will also verify that it will be able to
                         issue auxillary circuits to the other TYMCOM
                         X systems.  The results of any errors will
                         try to be corrected by the program itself,
                         but may require some operator intervention.
                         In this case, the operator will be instructed
                         what must be done to correct the errors.

                         The program on one system may be used to
                         verify the program on another system.  This
                         will not be recommended but will be possible
                         in the event the prorgram on the second
                         system will not function.  This operation
                         accross system will put a tremendous load on
                         the systems and TYMNET.


          REPORT         This directive will produce a report to the
                         line printer of all information normally
                         available by the above directives which
                         normally produce statistical and scheduling
                         output.


          MOVE           This directive will initiate the movement of
                         files between TYMCOM X systems.  It will
                         allow the user to detach if he so desires.


          CHANGE         This directive will permit the user to change
                         information contained in LMR data records by
                         the user specifying the item to be changed.
                         The valid items to be changed are as follows:
               NAME      This is used to change the name of a file.
               VERSION   This is used to change the version number
                         associated with a particular program.
               SCHEDULE  This will permit the user to change the
                         currently schedule of installation or removal
                         of a particular program or group of programs.
               SYSTEMS   This will allow the change of systems on
                         which a particular program will btalled
                         or removed.
               LICENSE   This will change the license given to a
                         particular program.
               CLASSIFICATION This will change the classification of a
                         particular file or program.
               RELATION  This will permit the modification of the

                         relationals for a particular file.


          REMOVE         This directive allows the entry of a schedule
                         for the removal of particular software.  The
                         information rquested will include the
                         software name, the system number and date of
                         removal.  This information will be entered
                         into the scheduler and transfered to all
                         systems for action at the appropriate time.
                         After the removal has occurred on all systems
                         specified, the information will be removed
                         automatically from the scheduler.


          DEFINE         This directive will allow the user to define
                         the installation of software as accepted and
                         installed software or for a test.  The
                         information will be entered into the
                         scheduler and distributed automatically to
                         all systems which are involved.

          All user license checks will be controlled by a single
          routine within LMR which will be passed the license required
          to be checked.  It will then check this against the license
          currently held by the user and will return a value of TRUE
          if the user has sufficient license to perform the function.
          If the user's license is less than required, the routine
          will inform the user what additional license is required and
          return the value FALSE.  The user may then select to us the
          SET LICENSE command to obtain the license required if he can
          do so or he may select to not execute the the command
          previously selected.

          User license checks will be made prior to the acceptance of
          the command directive since all operations performed by LMR
          will use the license given to the program rather than the
          user.  The SET directive may be used to alter the license
          required by LMR to execute a directive by stating the
          following:

          SET [(DIRECTIVE) (/SWITCH)] [NEW LICENSE]

          THE CURRENTLY REQUESTED LICENSE WILL BE PRINTED.  THE USER
          WILL BE REQUIRED TO HAVE THE MAXIMUM OR COMPOSITE LICENSE
          SET OF THE OLD AND NEW LICENSE REUQIREMENT OF THE THE
          DIRECTIVE BEING CHANGED.  IN ADDITION, IT WILL REQUIRE THAT
          THE USER HAVE WF (Write Files) license set in order to
          execute this directive.

          This area of concern is of upmost importance since LMR will
          be running with sufficient license to completely modify the
          running system.  It is imparative that unauthorized
          personnel not be able to accomplish this feat.

          PROGRAM RELATION This will be the unique character set which
                         connects files belonging to a particular
                         program.  It must be less than five (5)
                         characters.

          OPSYS RELATION This will be the relational that connects
                         various files belonging to or required by a
                         particular operating system.  It will usually
                         be the version number of the operating
                         system.

          GROUP RELATION This will be the relational that connects
                         various files belonging to a special group of
                         programs which should be run together on the

                         the software is in a test state.  If it is
                         positive, the software is considered
                         installed.  If it is zero, the software is
                         not installed.

          CONTROL POINTER This is the pointer to the scheduler.  It
                         tells LMR where the SCHEDULER information is
                         contained.  If it is set to minus one (-1)
                         there is no information in the SCHEDULER
                         concerning the file.

          VERSION        This is the current version number of the
                         program.  If it is set to minus one (-1),
                         this is not the file called by the user or
                         the OPERATING SYSTEM.  In otherwords, it is a
                         program accessed file.

          NEXT ENTRY     This will be a pointer to the next data block
                         for files associated with this program.  If
                         there are no other files, it will set to
                         minus one (-1).

          LAST ENTRY     This will be a pointer to the last data block
                         for files associated with this program.  If
                         there are no other files, it will be set to
                         minus one (-1)and if this is the first file
                         it will be set to zero.

          LOCATION       This will be the location of the files during
                         the transition period before installation and
                         after entry into the scheduler.

          NOTE: This will require approximately twenty (20) words of
                information per file maintained by LMR.  The program
                will be keyed to read a block at a time makeing it
                possible to have an unlimited number of programs on
                the system that are maintained by the program.

          The following is a list of valid switches which are
          available.  Make note, these switches are not valid with all
          commands but only with commands for which they may have a

          /?             This causes LMR to print a list of valid
                         switches for the directive given.  If no
                         directive has been given then a list of all
                         switches will be printed.

          /HELP          Same as /?

          /PERIOD        This switch will allow the user to modify the
                         time period used by the command.  If it is
                         immediately followed by and equal sign and an
                         number, i.e.  =45, the time period will be
                         set to 45 increments instead of the default.
                         If it is not, it will request the time
                         period.

          /OVERRIDE      This switch will cause LMR to overlook all
                         controls which would normally cause it to not
                         execute a command until a latter time, e.g.,
                         CLOAD is greater than LOAD.

          /ABORT         This will allow an abort character to be
                         specified to replace the standard interrupt.

          /NOABORT       This switch will prevent the user from
                         aborting the directive under any
                         circumstances.  All interrupts will be
                         disabled.

          FIX            This will instruct lmr to correct any errors
                         located during the execution of the
                         associated directive.

          /NOFIX         This switch will prevent LMR from making
                         corrections to errors found on the system.

          /BASE          This will inform LMR to perform the directive
                         only on the BASE system.

          /REFRESH       This switch will cause LMR to automatically
                         refresh or update its information obtained by
                         the directive.  This is equivalent to
                         executing the directive and then executing a
                         WRITE directive.

          /NOREFRESH     This directive will prevent LMR from updating
                         its information.  This is useful when using
                         directives that normally execute a WRITE
                         directive.

          /BACKUP        This switch will tell LMR to create a backup
                         of its information prior to execution of any
                         command which will change its data.

          /MISSING       This is a switch used in conjunction with the
                         SCAN directive to locate missing files on the
                         system.

                         objectives for the INFORMATION directive.


          OBJECTIVE      FUNCTION

          <program name> This will produce information on the program
                         or programs selected.
          V:<version number> This will affect the version number used
                         to locate the program specified.  If no
                         program is specified, all programs with the
                         version number specified will be delivered.
          F:<file name>  This will use the name of a file belonging to
                         a program to locate the information desired.
          C:<software classification> This will present the
                         information of all programs within the
                         specified classification.
          I:             This indicates the installed version of one
                         of the preceeding options.
          A:<date>       This indicates the creation date of one of
                         the preceeding options.  The date is used as
                         a base and everything occuring after that
                         date will be delivered.


          Any of the above may be combined as desired to obtain the
          information needed.  the use of P: or F: will cause the
          program to break and have the priovious information grouped
          to belong to the preceeding program.  Note that the I: and
          V: options would be contradictory.
