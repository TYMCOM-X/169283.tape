*LOADING PROCEDURE FOR RELOCATABLE FILES

THE LOAD ING PROCEDURE TO BE DESCRIBED IS INTENDED TO LOAD FIXED
CODE PLUS PAGES OF SIMPL CODE WHICH WILL BE PAGED IN AND OUT DURING
EXECUTION.  THE PAGES OF CODE ARE LOADED IN LOGICAL UNITS OF
2K WORDS, AND CAN BE WRITTEN TO A SPECIAL GO FILE FOR FAST LOADING.

FIRST THE FIXED CODE IS LOADED.  THIS CODE INCLUDES THE LINKAGE
ROUTINES, THE ANCHORS, AND SPECIAL FIXED CODE REQUIRED BY THE
OBJECT PROGRAM.  THE LOADING SEQUENCE IS TO START LOADING IN XDDT
USING THE USUAL ;T OR SIMILAR OPERATION.  WHEN ALL OF THE FIXED
CODE IS LOADED INTO THE LOWER PORTION OF CORE, THEN THE HIGH-WATER
MARK (PROBABLY %F) IS ASSIGNED TO THE CELL <.LAST>, AND CONTROL IS
TRANSFERED TO <LINKFX>.  WHEN CONTROL RETURNS TO XDDT, ALL APPROPRIATE
HOUSEKEEPING FOR THE FIXED PORTION OF CORE HAS BEEN PERFORMED, AND
LOADING OF THE LOGICAL PAGES MAY BE COMMENCED.

FOR EACH LOGICAL PAGE THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE IS PERFORMED:
        <COHART> IS ASSIGNED A VALUE WHICH WILL ALLOW SELECTION
         OF AN APPROPRIATE WINDOW FOR THE LOADING OPERATION.  IF
         <COHART> IS ASSIGNED THE VALUE OF A VALID LOGICAL PAGE, THEN
         A WINDOW WILL BE SELECTED SUCH THAT THE SPECIFIED PAGE AND
         THE PAGE NEXT LOADED SHARE A WINDOW.  IF <COHART> IS ASSIGNED
         THE NEGATIVE OF THE VALUE OF A VALID LOGICAL PAGE, THEN
         THE PAGE NEXT LOADED WILL BE ASSIGNED A WINDOW DISTINCT
         FROM THAT OF THE SPECIFIED PAGE (ASSUMING THE AVAILABILITY
         OF SUCH A WINDOW).  SUCH AN ASSIGNMENT WILL ATTEMPT TO
         LOAD-LEVEL THE PAGE ASSIGNMENTS TO THE WINDOWS.  IF A NON-
         VALID LOGICAL PAGE NUMBER IS ASSIGNED TO <COHART>, THEN
         SOME PAGE APPROPRIATELY SELECTED TO LOAD-LEVEL THE PAGE/
         WINDOW ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE CHOSEN.

        CONTROL IS TRANSFERED TO <LINKAD>.  WHEN CONTROL
         RETURNS TO XDDT, THE CELL <.F> WILL CONTAIN THE
         APPROPRIATE STARTING ADDRESS FOR LINK LOADIING THE LOGICAL
         PAGE.  THIS VALUE MAY BE ASSIGNED TO %F, OF USED VIA A %Q
         OR OTHER CONSTRUCT TO DIRECT THE LOADING OF THE
         RELOCATABLE FILES WHICH CONSTITUTE THE LOGICAL PAGE BEING
         LOADED.

        THE RELOCATABLE FILES ARE LOADED.

        THE VALUE OF ;F IS ASSIGNED TO THE CELL
        <.LAST>, THE LOGICAL PAGE NUMBER OF THE PAGE JUST LOADED
         IS ASSIGNED TO THE CELLL <.PAGE>

        CONTROL IS TRANSFERED TO LOCATION <LINKPG>.  WHEN CONTROL
         IS RETURNED TO XDDT, THE APPROPRIATE HOUSEKEEPING WILL HAVE
         BEEN PERFORMED TO ACCOMODATE THE NEW LOGICAL PAGE.

SYMBOL RESOLUTION

        ALL SYMBOLS FOR A LOGICAL PAGE MUST HAVE BEEN RESOLVED
         BEFORE CONTROL IS TRANSFERED TO <LINKPG> FOR THAT PAGE.

        AFTER ALL FIXED CODE ANN ALL LOGICAL PAGES HAVE BEEN LOADED,
         ALL SYMBOLS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED.

AFTER ALL FIXED CODE HAS BEEN LOADED, AND THEN ALL LOGICAL PAGES
HAVE BEEN LOADED, THE FOLLOWING CODE MUST BE PRESENT:

        RESIDENT LINK CODE
        NON-RESIDENT LINK CODE
        ANCHORS
        RESIDENT IOCS CODE
        NON-RESIDENT IOCS CODE

SAVING THE PROGRAM

AFTER LOADING IS COMPLETE, A GO FILE MAY BE CREATED BY TRANSFERING
CONTROL TO <.SAVE>.  A FILE NAME AND STARTING ADDRESS
WILL BE REQUESTED, AND A FILE CREATED WHICH WILL OPERATE
AS A GO FILE TO REESTABLISH THE PAGED ENVIRONMENT CREATED BY THE
XDDT LOADING PROCEDURE.
