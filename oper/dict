
II.   DICTIONARY
      ----------




   A. GENERAL DESCRIPTION



     IN ORDER TO PROVIDE AN EASY METHOD 1) OF DEFINING STANDARD

INTERVALS AND HEADINGS FOR ON-LINE UBT AND 2) OF FINDING OUT

WHAT A MNEMONIC IN THE MASTER DATA BASE OR WORK AREA MEANS, IT WAS 

DECIDED TO DEVELOP A "DICTIONARY" FOR ON-LINE MRIS.  THIS

DICTIONARY WILL FIRST OF ALL CONTAIN THE MNEMONIC (THREE LETTER CODE)

AND ITS NAME (DEFINITION) AND ANY REMARKS (COMMENTS) ABOUT THIS

MNEMONIC.  THUS, ANYTIME THE MRIS USER WISHES TO FIND OUT, FOR EXAMPLE

WHAT THE MNEMONIC "VRT" MEANS, HE CAN JUST "LOOK" IT UP

IMMEDIATELY IN THE "MRIS DICTIONARY". FURTHERMORE, TYMSHARE WILL 

PROVIDE A T & T WITH THE REVERSE PROCEDURE.  IF THE MRIS USER KNOWS

WHAT THE KEY WORD OR WORDS IN THE DEFINITION IS OR SHOULD

BE, AND HE DOES NOT KNOW THE MNEMONIC USED IN THE MRIS DATA BASE,

THE DICTIONARY WILL TRY TO HELP HIM FIND THE MNEMONIC.

     ASSOCIATED WITH THIS "DEFINITION" CAPABILITY, WILL BE THE

DEFAULT INTERVALS(UPPER AND LOWER LIMITS) AND DEFAULT HEADINGS

FOR THESE MNEMONICS TO BE USED IN THE NEW "UBT" COMMAND.  IF THE 

USER WISHES, THESE DEFAULT MODES CAN BE USED WITH UBT AND THE USER

DOES NOT HAVE TO INPUT THE HEADINGS AND RANGES EACH TIME HE RUNS 

UBT.  HOWEVER, IF THE USER WISHES TO INPUT HEADINGS AND

INTERVAL RANGES HE WILL BE GIVEN THE OPTION TO DO SO.

     IN THE EVENT THAT THE USER HAS USED THE TRANSFORMATION COMMAND

ON HIS DATA BASE, THE USER WILL BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEFINE

INTERVALS AND HEADINGS FOR THIS NEW MNEMONIC ALSO.  IT WILL BE

INCLUDED IN A NEW DICTIONARY FILE THAT IS CONNECTED WITH THAT WORK

AREA UNIQUELY.  IT WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE MASTER DICTIONARY.

THIS SMALLER DICTIONARY CONTAINING THE NEWLY CREATED

MNEMONICS WILL BE "SAVED" WHENEVER THE USER GIVES THE "SAVE" COMMAND TO

SAVE HIS WORK AREA.  THIS "SMALLER" DICTIONARY WILL BE DELETED

WHEN THE USER GIVES THE "DELETE" COMMAND TO ERASE A PREVIOUSLY

SAVED WORK AREA.

     ALSO INCLUDED WILL BE A CALCULATION RULES FILE THAT

WILL INDICATE WHAT CALCULATIONS ARE TO BE DONE BEFORE REPORTING

THAT MNEMONIC TO UBT IF THE USER HAS CHOSEN A DERRIVED

MNEMONIC.  FOR EXAMPLE, M75=M74/M47, INDICATES THAT M75 IS A DERRIVED

MNEMONIC BY TAKING ONE MASTER DATA BASE (WORK AREA) MNEMONIC AND

DIVIDING IT BY ANOTHER MNEMONIC TO GET A NEW VALUE.  THE DERRIVED

MNEMONIC CAN BE PUT INTO THE DICTIONARY OF INTERVALS AND HEADINGS

AND IN THE DEFINITION SECTION OF THE DICTIONARY.

       IF A MNEMONIC IS DEMOGRAPHIC, THIS WILL ALSO BE INDICATED

IN THE DICTIONARY AND IF THE USER WISHES TO FIND OUT

WHAT THE CODES STAND FOR, HE WILL REFERENCE THE DEMOGRAPHIC

FILE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DICTIONARY. ALL CODES ASSOCIATED WITH

DEMOGRAPHIC MNEMONICS WILL BE STORED IN THIS FILE.  ONE

OR MORE MNEMONICS IN THE DICTIONARY MAY REFERENCE THE SAME 

DEMOGRAPHIC CODES.

     THE DICTIONARY WILL ALSO CONTAIN THE NUMBER OF DECIMAL

PLACES THAT THIS FIELD SHOULD CONTAIN WHEN OUTPUTTED TO THE TERMINAL.





   B.  CREATION



     THE DICTIONARY WILL BE SET UP VIA A CONVERSATIONAL

PROGRAM.  THIS PROGRAM WILL PROMPT FOR ALL THE NECESSARY INFORMATION

TO BE CONTAINED IN THE DICTIONARY.  ALSO INCLUDED WILL BE AN EDITING

CAPABILITY SO THAT THE USER CAN MODIFY THIS DICTIONARY, AND

A LISTING CAPABILITY TO ALLOW THE USER TO SEE THE CONTENTS OF

THE DICTIONARY.  THE FOLLOWING IS AN OUTLINE OF THE INFORMATION

THAT WILL BE INCLUDED.  IN ORDER TO KEEP STORAGE AT A MINIMUM,

THE DICTIONARY WILL ACTUALLY BE CONTAINED IN FOUR SEPARATE FILES.

STORAGE CAN BE REDUCED SINCE THERE IS DUPLICATION OF RANGES FOR SOME

MNEMONICS' RANGES.  A POINTER IN ONE FILE WILL BE USED TO INDICATE

WHAT RANGE TO USE FOR TWO MNEMONICS HAVING THE SAME RANGES AND 

HEADINGS OR THE SAME DEMOGRAPHIC CODES.  THE RANGES/HEADINGS AND 

THE DEMOGRAPHIC CODES WILL BE IN THE OTHER TWO FILES.

THE FOURTH FILE WILL CONTAIN THE CALCULATION RULES FOR THE DERRIVED

MNEMONICS.

     THESE WILL BE THE FOUR FILES:

          1. DEFINITION FILE
          2. DEMOGRAPHIC FILE
          3. HEADING AND INTERVAL FILE
          4. CALCULATION RULES FILE



     C. FILE DESCRIPTION


DEFINITION FILE
---------- ----



     THIS FILE WILL CONTAIN 1 RECORD FOR EACH VARIABLE IN THE

MASTER DATA BASE.  ADDITIONAL RECORDS FOR DERRIVED MNEMONICS CAN 

ALSO BE INCLUDED. THIS WILL BE THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS FILE:


     1. MNEMONIC(VARIABLE)- THE MNEMONIC (THREE LETTER CODE) CODE
        CONTAINED IN THE MRIS DATA BASE. THIS IS A UNIQUE 3 LETTER
        CODE ASSOCIATED WITH EACH FIELD IN THE DATA BASE.

     2. NUMBER OF DECIMAL PLACES - THE NUMBER OF PLACES TO THE RIGHT
        OF THE DECIMAL TO BE INCLUDED ON THE OUTPUT OF SOME REPORTS.


     3. NAME- AN ENGLISH DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE MNEMONIC
        STANDS FOR.ITS DEFINITION.

     4. COMMENTS(REMARKS)- ANY REMARKS TO BE MADE ABOUT THIS FIELD.

     5. REFERENCE MNEMONIC FOR DEFAULT HEADINGS AND RANGES. -
        THIS WILL LINK THIS RECORD TO ONE IN THE INTERVAL/HEADING
        FILE.

     6. REFERENCE MNEMONIC FOR DEMOGRAPHIC CODES- THIS WILL LINK
        THIS RECORD TO A RECORD IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC FILE.




DEMOGRAPHIC FILE
----------- ----



     THIS WILL CONTAIN UNIQUE SETS OF DEMOGRAPHIC CODES. THERE WILL BE

ONE RECORD FOR EACH CODE. SINCE SOME OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC CODES SETS ARE

USED REPEATEDLY, IT IS UNNECESSARY TO STORE DUPLICATE DEMOGRAPHIC 

CODES.  THEREFORE, ONLY UNIQUE CODE SETS WILL BE NEEDED.  WHEN ANOTHER

VARIABLE, FOR EXAMPLE, SAY FEM USES THE SAME DEMOGRAPHIC CODE AS

ANOTHER VARIABLE SAY MAL, THIS WILL BE CITED IN THE "DEFINITION"

FILE AS FEM REFERENCING THE MAL DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION CODES.

THEREFORE,  MAL CODES MUST BE IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC FILE.  

SIMILARLY, SINCE HEADINGS CAN BE DUPLICATES ALSO, ANOTHER

FIELD IN THE "DEFINITION" FILE WILL BE SET UP TO REFERENCE UNIQUE

HEADING AND RANGES INTERVAL SETS.  THERE WILL BE AS MANY RECORDS

FOR EACH MNEMONIC AS THE NUMBER OF CODES FOR THAT MNEMONIC. SO IF

THER ARE 10 CODES FOR MNEMONIC "MAL", THERE WILL BE 10 "MAL" RECORDS.

THE FOLLOWING IS THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS FILE:

     1. MNEMONIC REFERENCED BY FIELD 4 IN THE "DEFINITION" FILE.
        THIS FIELD CONTAINS THE VARIABLE WHOSE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
        IS USED BY ONE OR MORE MNEMONICS.

     2. DEMOGRAPHIC CODE- THIS IS THE CODE CONTAINED IN THE MRIS
        DATA BASE. EXAMPLE, 1 OR 2 OR 3 OR 10.

     3. DEMOGRAPHIC DEFINITION- WHAT THE DEMOGRAPHIC CODE MEANS
        EXAMPLE, LESS THAN $3000




HEADING AND RANGE INTERVAL FILE
------- --- ----- -------- ----




     THIS FILE WILL CONTAIN ALL UNIQUE SETS OF RANGES AND THE HEADINGS

ASSOCIATED WITH EACH RANGE.  THESE HEADINGS WILL BE USED AS THE ROW/

COLUMN HEADINGS ON THE UBT REPORTS.  THERE WILL BE ONE RECORD FOR

EACM MNEMONIC.  SO IF THERE ARE 5 RANGES FOR ROWS OR COLUMNS FOR THE

MNEMONIC "TOL", THERE WILL BE 5 "TOL" RECORDS.  THE FOLLOWING INFOR-

MATION WILL BE INCLUDED IN EACH RECORD OF THIS FILE:

     1. MNEMONIC REFERENCED BY FIELD 3 OF THE "DEFINITION" FILE.
        THIS FIELD IS THE MNEMONIC NAME WHOSE HEADING IS USED BY 1
        OR MORE MNEMONICS IN THE DEFINITION FILE.

     2. LOWER LIMIT - THIS IS THE LOWER LIMIT OF THE RANGE.  

     3. UPPER LIMIT - THIS IS THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE RANGE FOR
        THIS ONE INTERVAL. THE PROGRAM WILL CHECK TO SEE IF IT IS
        GREATER THEN THE  PREVIOUS UPPER LIMIT BUT LESS THAN
        OR EQUAL TO THIS UPPER LIMIT.  THAT IS,  A<X<=B  WHERE
        A IS THE PREVIOUS UPPER LIMIT AND B IS THE CURRENT UPPER LIMIT.

     4. HEADING TO BE PRINTED ON ROW/COLUMN ON UBT REPORT. 
        THIS FIELD  WILL CONTAIN THE HEADING INFORMATION.  IN ORDER
        TO REDUCE THE HORIZONTAL SPACING, A HEADING CAN BE PUT
        ON MORE THAN ONE LINE OF THE REPORT IF THE HEADING CONTAINS A
        BACK SLASH(\).  THIS WILL INDICATE THAT THE HEADING SHOULD
        BE SPLIT THERE AND PLACED ON A NEW LINE.  EXAMPLE,
        SUPPOSE THE USER WANTS THE HEADING "OVER 65 YEARS", BUT HE DOES
        NOT WANT THIS PRINTED ON ONE LINE OF THE REPORT BUT ON TWO
        LINES.   TO  INDICATE THIS HE WOULD INPUT THIS IN THE
        HEADING FIELD AS FOLLOWS: OVER 65\YEARS.  THIS WOULD 
        PRODUCE THE FOLLOWING HEADING    OVER 65
                                          YEARS






CALCULATION RULES FILE
----------- ----- ----



     THIS FILE WILL CONTAIN A LIST OF THE DERRIVED MNEMONICS AND THE

RULES USED TO CALCULATE THE VALUE OF THE DERRIVED MNEMONIC.  THE

VALUE WILL BE A REAL NUMBER CONTAINING UP TO FOUR DECIMAL PLACES.

WHEN THE USER REQUESTS A DERRIVED MNEMONIC, THE CALCULATION WILL BE 

DONE BEFORE THE UBT REPORT STATISTICS ARE CALCULATED. THIS WILL 

PROVIDE AN AUTOMATIC CALCULATION OF THOSE FIGURES THAT ARE VERY

IMPORTANT TO THE MRIS USER.  THE CALCULATION WILL BE

STATED IN THIS FILE.  THE CALCULATION MUST BE A COMBINATION

OF VALID MASTER DATA BASE MNEMONICS AND VALID OPERATIONS.

THE VALID OPERATIONS ARE:
     + FOR ADDITION
     - FOR SUBTRACTION
     / FOR DIVISION
     * FOR MULTIPLICATION
    ** FOR EXPONENTIATION
   LOG FOR LOG TO BASE E
 LOG10 FOR LOG TO BASE 10
  SQRT FOR SQUARE ROOT


     THE CONTENTS OF THE FILE WILL BE:
 
     1. DERRIVED MNEMONIC CODE. THIS IS A THREE LETTER CODE TO
        BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FIELD.

     2. CALCULATION USED TO OBTAIN THE VALUE OF THE DERRIVED
        MNEMONIC.  EXAMPLE T01+T03+T03 COULD BE THE CALCULATION
        FOR 1QR, WHERE 1QR IS THE DERRIVED MNEMONIC CODE.



     THE CALCULATIONS WILL BE USED SOLELY FOR THE UBT

COMMAND.
