I.  Introduction

    The Medline Simulated User System (MSUS) provides the National
    Library of Medicine with a method to analyze the effect and
    inter-relationship of Medline user loads and Medline system
    changes.

    The primary steps in the use of the MSUS system are summarized
    below:

    A.  A control file is prepared using Tymshare's LNED package. 
        The control file contains user-characteristics and the
        input lines for a simulated session.  These lines are
        entered in exactly the same format as they would normally
        be entered on-line into Medline.

    B.  The program SSUP (Single Simulated User Program) is invoked
        to send a particular control file to Medline over Tymnet.
        The interactions are performed at a measured rate of speed
        so as to simulate the user characteristics specified in
        the control file.

    C.  The program SSUR (Single Simulated User Reports) displays
        selected information and analyses for any simulated session
        performed by SSUP.

II. Operation Categories -- The MEDVAL File


    A.  Purpose of MEDVAL

        Any Medline operation (command or search word) can be assigned
        a reference number by the user of the MSUS system.  This num-
        ber will facilitate detailed analysis of simulated sessions
        involving the referenced operation.

        The association of numbers with operations is defined by the
        MEDVAL file.  This file must have the name MEDVAL and must
        exist in each Tymshare file directory from which MSUS is used.

    B.  Structure of MEDVAL

        The format of a record in the MEDVAL file is shown in these
        examples:

              37,MELANOMA
              13,"PRT"
              5,HEART
              13,"PRINT"

        The numbers are left justified and terminated by a comma.
        Each must be between 1 and 99.

        The operation name begins immediately following the comma
        and terminates on a carriage return.  If the operation is
        a command, then it must be  enclosed in quotes, just as
        it would be in a Medline session.  The same number can be
        associated with more than one operation name, as in the
        long and short forms of the "PRINT" command shown above.

        The MEDVAL file is used by SSUP to categorize each simul-
        ated interaction.

        The first "word" of each input line is compared by SSUP
        to each operation name in the MEDVAL file.  If a match is
        found, then that interaction is tagged with the corresponding
        number.  If no match is found, the interaction is tagged
        with the number zero.

        The record

              13,"PRT"

        in the MEDVAL file will match any of

              "PRT" cr              NOTE:  cr denotes a carriage return
              "PRT  1" cr                  input by the user.
              "PRT  SS  15" cr

        in a user input line, but would not match any of these in
        an input line:

              PRT cr
              "PRTTY"  cr

        The MEDVAL record

              TREE cr

        would match

              TREE  OR  BUSH cr
              TREE cr

        but not

              "TREE" cr
              "TREE  ALGAE" cr
              TREED cr

    C.  Creation and Maintenance of MEDVAL

        MEDVAL is created and maintained by the MSUS user (NLM staff).
        The suggested tool for this task is Tymshare's LNED package.
        LNED is a very easy-to-use text editor which permits the user
        to enter, delete or modify records (lines) simply by enter-
        ing the number of the line and the desired contents.  This
        example illustrates the use of LNED to create a MEDVAL file.

            -[LNED]
              READY
             [100 1,"PRT" cr]          Operation number and names
             [200 2,HEART cr]          entered with a line number
             [300 3,MELANOMA cr]       assigned by user for future
             [400 1,"PRINT" cr]        reference.  Control A can
             [500 20,HEALTH cr]        correct an erroneous
             [600 7,"ERASE" cr]        character
             [LIST cr]
              100 1,"PRT"

              400 1,"PRINT"            is displayed by LIST command.
              500 20,HEALTH
              600 7,"ERASE"
              READY
             [150 6,EXPLODE cr]        A new line can easily be inserted
             [LIST cr]                 between 100 and 200.
              100 1,"PRT"
              150 6,EXPLODE
              200 2,HEART
              300 3,MELANOMA           The insertion is easily verified.
              400 1,"PRINT"
              500 20,HEALTH
              600 7,"ERASE"
              READY
              [SAVE MEDVAL]            The data must be explicitly
              READY                    saved for future use.
             [QUIT cr]


        MEDVAL can be accessed by LNED after its initial creation
        to perform updates:

             [LNED cr]
              READY
             [LOAD MEDVAL cr]
              READY
             [LIST cr]
              100 1,"PRT"
              150 6,EXPLODE
              200 2,HEART
              300 3,MELANOMA
              400 1,"PRINT"
              500 20,HEALTH
              600 7,"ERASE"
              READY
             [250 5,"ERSLL" cr]        A new operation category can be
             [SAVE MEDVAL cr]          specified and saved on the perm-
                                       anent MEDVAL file
              OLD FILE.  OK TO WRITE OVER IT?    [YES cr]
              READY
             [QUIT cr]

        The LNED capabilities demonstrated above should be sufficient
        for the purpose of maintaining MEDVAL.  Additional LNED
        features are explained in the attatched LNED reference manual.

III. Simulator Command -- The Control File

    A.  Control File Structure

        A Control File is the description of a simulated session to be
        performed by MSUS.  The control file contains two kinds of rec-
        ords:

              A.  SSUP Command Records:  these describe user
                  characteristics to be simulated, such as input 
                  typing speed.

              B.  Medline Text Records:  these are input lines to 
                  be sent to Medline by SSUP.

        The Medline Text Records appear in the control file in precisely
        the same format expected by Medline.  The SSUP Command
        Records are distinguished by the presence of an ampersand
        (&) as the initial character.

        The valid SSUP commands are given in the following table:

       
    B.  Control File Commands

               [Control Command]            [Meaning]

                &TERMINAL=30CPS          Define terminal speed
                                         to be simulated for
                                         Medline printout. Options
                                         are 10 15 or 30 CPS.
                                         This command can be omitted,
                                         yielding a default assump-
                                         tion of 10CPS.

                &TYPIST=6CPS             Specifies the average typist
                                         speed to be simulated for
                                         Medline input.  Default is
                                         5CPS.

                &ERRORS=10%              Specifies average number of
                                         user mis-strokes to be sim-
                                         ulated.  Default is 0%.

                &USER=NLM;NLM03          Selects user-name and project-
                                         Code to be used for the simula-
                                         ted session.

                &WIDTH=80                This is the maximum number
                                         of characters to be saved
                                         from any Medline response
                                         on the SSUP output file. 
                                         Default is 30.

                &RUN                     Marks the end of Control
                                         Commands.  The following
                                         Control File lines will be
                                         Medline Text Records and
                                         will not begin with an
                                         ampersand (&).

                &FINISH                  Signifies the end of the
                                         Control File to SSUP.  This
                                         record follows the last Med-
                                         line Text Record.  When
                                         &FINISH is encountered, SSUP
                                         will send to Medline

                                            "STOP"
                                               Y

                                         to terminate the session.

    C.  Preparation of Control Files

           Control Files can be created and modified using LNED.  In
           addition to the LNED features covered in the discussion of
           MEDVAL, the DELETE and MERGE commands are useful for
           handling Control Files.  In the following example, a set of
           user characteristics (Control File Commands) is created
           which can be combined with different sets of Medline Text
           records.

           Initially a simple Control File (TRYEMBOL) is created:

               [LNED cr]
               READY
               [10 &TERMINAL=15CPS cr]
               [20 &TYPIST=5CPS cr]
               [30 &ERRORS=5% cr]
               [40 &USER=NLM;MEDTYM03 cr]
               [50 &WIDTH=120 cr]
               [60 &RUN cr]
               [70 E cr]
               [80 "VERSION SHORT ALL" cr]
               [110 "USERS" cr]
               [120 EMBOLISM, AIR cr]
               [130 HUMAN OR NOT HUMAN cr]
               [140 EMBOLISM, AIR/SU OR EMBOLISM, AIR/TH OR EMBOLISM, AIR/DT OR
               [150 EMBOLISM, AIR/RT OR EMBOLISM, AIR/PC cr]
               [160 3 EYE NEOPLASMS AND IRIS AND MELONOMA cr]
               [170 EYE NEOPLASMS AND IRIS AND MELONOMA cr]
               [180 MELANOMA cr]
               [190 "PRT SS 4, TI, 10" cr]
               [200 Y cr]
               [210 1 AND 5 cr]
               [9999 &FINISH cr]
               [SAVE TRYEMBOL cr]
               READY

           The Medline Text Records can then be deleted, leaving
           only the user-characteristics:

               [DELETE 70-210 cr]
               READY
               [SAVE CHARAC cr]
               OLD FILE.  OK TO WRITE OVER IT ?  [YES cr]
               READY
               [LIST cr]
               10 &TERMINAL=15CPS
               [20 &TYPIST=5CPS cr]
               [30 &ERRORS=5% cr]
               [40 &USER=NLM;MEDTYM03 cr]
               [50 &WIDTH=120 cr]
               [60 &RUN cr]
               [9999 &FINISH cr]
               READY

           These characteristics can then be merged with other Medline
           Text Records:

               -LNED
               READY
               [260 HEART, MECHANICAL OR HEART, ARTIFICIAL cr]
               [270 PROSTHESIS OR PROSTHESIS DESIGN OR HEART/TR OR HEART/SU cr]
               [280 1 AND 2 OR HEART, MECHANICAL OR HEART, ARTIFICIAL cr]
               [290 1 AND 2 OR HEART, MECHANICAL AND HEART, ARTIFICIAL cr]
               [300 4 AND HUMAN OR 4 AND NOT ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS cr]
               [310 5 AND NOT FOREIGN cr]
               [320 "PRT TI, 16" cr]
               READY
               [MERGE CHARAC cr]
               READY
               [LIST cr]
               [10 &TERMINAL=15CPS cr]
               [20 &TYPIST=5CPS cr]
               [30 &ERRORS=5% cr]
               [40 &USER=NLM;MEDTYM03 cr]
               [50 &WIDTH=120 cr]
               [60 &RUN cr]
               [260 HEART, MECHANICAL OR HEART, ARTIFICIAL cr]
               [270 PROSTHESIS OR PROSTHESIS DESIGN OR HEART/TR OR HEART/SU cr]
               [280 1 AND 2 OR HEART, MECHANICAL OR HEART, ARTIFICIAL cr]
               [290 1 AND 2 OR HEART, MECHANICAL AND HEART, ARTIFICIAL cr]
               [300 4 AND HUMAN OR 4 AND NOT ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS cr]
               [310 50AND NOT FOREIGN cr]
               [320 "PRT TI, 16" cr]
               [9999 &FINISH cr]
               READY
               [SAVE TRYHEART cr]
               READY


IV. Running the Simulator--SSUP

    A.  Function of SSUP

        SSUP--the Single Simulated User Program -- is the heart of MSUS.
        SSUP obeys any selected Control File to conduct a simulated 
        session of the Medline system.

        SSUP transmits the Medline Text Records to Medline at the rate
        of speed, and according to the specifications set, in the Control
        File.

    B.  Operation of SSUP 

        SSUP requires the specifications of a Control File name and an
        Interaction File name:

            -[SSUP cr]

            INTERACTION FILE NAME:[OUTMELA cr]
         
            NEW FILE [cr]

            CONTROL FILE NAME:[TRYMELANOMA cr]

            OK

            COMPLETED - 12 COMMAND INTERACTIONS
            ELAPSED SIMULATION TIME - 8:37.4

        On the Interaction File will be recorded a complete accounting
        of the simulated session: The user characteristics, all Medline
        Text input Records, all Medline System responses, and the elapsed
        times experienced for each transaction.


V.  Recording the Session -- The Interaction File

        In each Interaction File record the first four data fields 
        have the same meaning.  The Interaction File is an IML-
        compatibility structured file with three distinct record
        types.

[Field Name]         [Width]     [Type]        [Description]

  LENGTH                4        Numeric        Record size, in characters

VI. Reports and Analysis -- SSUR

    A.  Operation of SSUR

        The SSUR (Single Simulated-User Reports) program provides for
        the creation of several reports and analyses of simulated Med-
        line tests.  When SSUR is called, the prompt

            REPORT DESIRED:

        is printed.  The user can respond with any of the available
        report names:

            MUSET

            MUSAD

            MUSSC

        These reports are described in detail on the following pages.

           ENTER TEST DATA RESULTS FILE:

        The response to this may be 'T' for terminal or a file name,
        if the user desires the report to be put on a file.

        All decisions relating to the input data for these reports and
        the output requirements will be requested interactively through
        program prompting.

        The reports will be written on a narrow (72) carriage terminal
        and will not assume a formfeed capability.  Each page of the
        report will have sixty lines and will be output directly to
        the specified file.

    B.  MUSET: MEDLINE USER SYSTEM ELAPSED TIME

        This report will print the Elapsed Time listing for any specified
        test.  The user identifies the Interaction File name and the
        specific Operation numbers that are to be sought.

        In order to help the user decide which Operation numbers to
        select, he is given the option to view the MEDVAL file:

            DO YOU WANT A LIST OF OPERATION NUMBERS (YES OR NO):

        If the user answers YES, then the MEDVAL file, which contains
        Operation numbers and names, will be printed on the terminal.

        The user is then asked to supply the name of the Interaction
        File to be processed:

            INTERACTION FILE NAME:


        After the Interaction File is opened successfully, the user
        must identify which of four possible elapsed times are wanted;
        send, wait, output, or total interaction time.

            ENTER TIME DESIRED FOR ANALYSIS:

        Next are required the Medline operations to be analyzed:

           ENTER THE DESIRED OP-CODE NUMBERS

        The user must enter the Operation numbers or ranges of
        interest.  Sample selections are:

            1,2
            5:20
            1,2,5:20
            ALL

        Only those interaction records whose Operation number
        is selected by one of the ranges will be included in the
        report.  The range ALL will cause every record to be
        used.

        The layout of the report body will be:


PAGE XXX                   MEDLINE ELAPSED TIME         XX/XX  XX:XX

    C.  MUSAD:  MEDLINE USER SIMULATOR ANALYSIS and DISTRIBUTION

        This report will have two options; Elapsed Time Analysis and
        Elapsed Time Distribution.  These options will be available
        for any Medline test.  Any one of four times; send, wait, out-
        put, or total can be shown in the reports.  The time intervals
        that will be used may be entered online or from a file:

            TIME INTERVAL FILE:  T OR FILENAME

        If the response is not a 'T', then it must be a LNED-created
        file that has the data.  In either case, the format of the
        data is one time-interval per line:

            0:3
            3:5
            0:5
            0:99
            END


        The list is terminated by 'END' and the intervals may
        overlap if desired.  After accepting the interval list, SSUR
        will prompt for the name of the Interaction File.

            INTERACTION FILE NAME:

        After the Interaction File name is accepted, SSUR requests
        the type of output desired:

            ENTER THE DESIRED REPORT SELECTION:

        The report choices available are:

            1 - Elapsed Time Analysis

            2 - Elapsed Time Distribution

            3 - Elapsed Time Analysis and Distribution

        Any other response will cause a list of valid responses
        to be printed.  Then the user prompt will be repeated.

        After the individual report is selected, the user must identify
        which data will be analyzed.  The user must indicate what
        Operator numbers should be used in each column of the report.
        The commands selected will be entered as commands or command
        ranges as follows:

            ENTER OP-CODE RANGES FOR EACH COLUMN

            COLUMN 1:[1,100 cr]

            COLUMN 2:[11,20,41:50 cr]

            COLUMN 3:[ALL cr]

            COLUMN 4:[cr]

        A blank line as input for a column will indicate all columns
        have been entered.

        The Elapsed-Time Analysis option displays the number of
        Interaction Records which are selected by each column and
        which fall into the time interval specified for each row:

        column the number of Interaction Records falling into each
        time interval as a percentage of all Interaction specified
        by that column description:

        When the combined report (option 3) is selected, then both
        the count and percentage figures are printed adjacent to one
        another in the body of the report.  The column and TITLE lay-
        out is identical to the first two options.

    D.  MUSSC:  MEDLINE USER SIMULATOR SOURCE COMPARISON

        This report will isolate any output differences between two
        tests.  The user will identify the Interaction Files to be
        compared, and the specific items in each file.  The report
        will contain all information for any interactions that have
        differences.  The initial prompts are:

            ENTER THE TWO INTERACTION FILENAMES.

            FILE1:  XXX cr

            FILE2:  XXX cr

            RESULTS TO:  'T' OR FILENAME

        After the files have been opened, the text of corresponding
        interactions will be compared; i.e., first to first, etc.
        If both Interaction Files were created by the same Control
        File, then only differences in Medline Responses will
        be sought.  Otherwise, User-Interaction inputs will also be
        compared.  If the stored output length of the interactions
        is different, then only the portion common will be compared.
        If any differences are found, then the complete inter-
        action will be recorded.  This will include user and system
        responses.  The program will total the number of differences
        and print the total at the end of execution:
