     The following is the syntax for the node  specification
for the node information and circuit tracing commands.

     nodespec := nodelist|ALL|BASES|REMOTES|@filename
     nodelist := node|noderange|nodepair|nodelist,nodelist
     noderange := node:node
     nodepair := node/node
     node := nn|nn(linelist)
     nn := [nodename]|[node number]
     linelist := digit|digit,linelist
     digit := 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8


     [nodename] and [node number] are  the  node  names  and
numbers as in use for the network.

     @filename  will  read  a  node  list  from  "filename".
"filename"  must  be  a  symbolic file and the format is the
same as  nodespec  except  that  carriage  returns  will  be
treated as commas and the first blank will be considered the
end of the line.  The file may not however  contain  another
@filename designation.
