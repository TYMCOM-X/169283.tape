        General Information

           This document describes operating instructions
           for updating the 370 detail information in the CAIS database
           and making various reports from the database.
           The procedures can be completely performed in the order given
           but in many cases it will be useful to do one part before
           another.  A brief description of the major parts will show
           relevant dependencies:

           a. 1.1   Makes a copy of the file directory for c. and d.
                Must be run after a new data file (or files) has been
                loaded into the CAIS directory.

           b. 1.2   Defines all possible data file names (up to
                a specified cutoff date) for parts c. and d.
                Must be run only once to define file names for all
                current computer numbers up to the specified date 
                (date of last data file or last day of month).

           c. 2.    Session record update.  May be run repeatedly before
                or after part d. until all data files have been processed.
                Section 2.5 describes a report procedure that is run only
                after completion of all session record updates for the
                current run.

           d. 3.    Storage record update.  May be run repeatedly before
                or after part c. until all storage data files have been
                processed.

           e. 4.    System usage graphs.  To be run every monday and at
                end of month.  Used to produce graphs for weekday
                usage and monthly usage.

        Anytime the command MAGNUM CAIS is typed, the command
        DO CHECK.370 should be typed.  Any errors in the procedures
        or command files will cause an abort.  The missing or bad file
        should be restored before continuing.

                             START-UP Procedure


        Introduction.

           The START-UP consist of two independant steps, MAKDIR and
           IN.FILE.CNTL. MAKDIR creates a file directory image to the file
           FILDIR.CTL to be used in a later procedure. 
           IN.FILE.CNTL creates 370 accounting file names, based on legal host 
           no., start date of last run and type of file, permanent storage
           (PS) or session records (SR). Writes all names to a relation
           in CAIS.



        Interactive Commands.

           1.0  LOG-IN to 38, GFD to CAIS.

           1.1  -GO (CAIS)MAKDIR <CR>

                ENTER YOUR NAME: Operator Name <CR>

                ENTER YOUR PASSWORD: Password <CR>

                OUTPUT TO: FILDIR.CTL <CR>

                OLD FILE--OK? Y <CR>

                END MAKDIR


           1.2  MAGNUM CAIS <CR>

                :DO CHECK.370

                :DO SET.UPD.FILES

                PREVIOUS ACTG. CUTOFF DATE EQUALS   M/D/YY

                ENTER NEW CUTOFF DATE AS (M/D/YY): ENTER DATE <CR>

                END 370 INPUT FILE CONTROL  M/D/YY


           NOTE: The new CUTOFF date corresponds to the file name RANGE
                 to account for. Start date and the new CUTOFF date are
                 inclusive.



        Crash-Recovery.

           If the system crashes or the line is lost, the following
           steps must be implemented in order to insure a sussccessful
           recovery:


                Crash during MAKDIR--> re-run MAKDIR


                Crash during SET.UPD.FILES--> perform the following:

                  1.3  :DO SET.UPD.FILES.RESTORE

                  This re-runs step 1.2 above


        End START-UP Procedure.

                        SESSION-RECORD Update (SESS.UPD)



        Introduction.

           SESS.UPD reads the 370 daily session activity file and inserts
           them to appropriate relations in CAIS. SESS.UPD processes
           transaction and premimum details.


        Interactive Commands.

           2.1  MAGNUM CAIS <CAIS>

                :DO CHECK.370

               NOTE: If running B.O.M Procedures do step 2.2
                     else do step 2.3

           2.2 :DO SESS.UPD.BOM <CR>       GO TO STEP 2.4

           2.3 :DO SESSION.UPD <CR>

           2.4  If the procedure displays FILE NOT FOUND enter
                   one of the following:

                   I --> Ignore file during the accounting run. This
                         will occur if the 370 EXEC program RAWACTG is
                         not run on a daily basis.

                   S --> Skip file should be used when sess.upd is looking
                         for a file that has not been transfered from
                         the 370 to C38.

                   Q --> Quit from any further processing.


           NOTE: A response of I will prevent the procedure from looking
                 for that file again. Ensure that the file NEVER exist 
                 before entering I.


        Crash-Recovery.

           If the system crashes, the procedure ABORTS for any reason,
           or the line is lost, the following steps must be implemented
           in order to insure a successful recovery.


                Crash during SESSION.UPD --> DO SESS.UPD.RESTORE

                Crash during SESS.UPD.BOM --> DO SESS.UPD.BOM.RESTORE

        If the operator is not going to do the RESTORE operation 
        immediately, he should do the following to release excess
        storage.

                RUN SESS.DLT


            2.5 :DO COLLECT

                In case of any error during this procedure, repeat
                the command, DO COLLECT.
                This procedure writes network information files and does
                not effect the database.



        End SESS.UPD Procedure.

                PERMANENT STORAGE And USER VALIDATION (STG.UPD)



        Intrduction.

           STG.UPD processes 370 Permanent Storage and User Validation
           files transfered from the 370 to C38. STG.UPD will update all
           prior storage records based upon update code. It will
           also add, change or cancel User Validation records.


        Interactive Commands.

           3.0  -MAGNUM CAIS <CR>

                :DO CHECK.370

           3.1  :DO STORAGE.UPD


           3.3  If the procedure displays FILE NOT FOUND enter
                one of the following:

                   I --> Ignore file during the accounting run. This
                         will occur if the 370 EXEC program RAWACTG is
                         not run on a daily basis.

                   S --> Skip file should be used when stg.upd is looking
                         for a file that has not been transfered from
                         the 370 to C38.

                         NOTE: This Command should NEVER be used unless
                               EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZED!

                   Q --> Quit from any further processing.


           NOTE: A response of I will prevent the procedure from looking
                 for that file again. Ensure that the file NEVER exist 
                 before entering I.


           3.4  List out error file STORAG.ERR


        Crash-Recovery.

           If the system crashes or a line is lost, the following
           steps must be implemented in order to insure a successful
           recovery.


                  3.5  List out error file STORAG.ERR

                       :DO STG.UPD.RESTORE


        End STG.UPD Procedure.

                        SYSTEM USAGE PROCEDURES

        Introduction.

           There are two procedures related to recording
           system usage. These are "COUNT.USE" which is run from
           a command file "CNT.USE" which counts the system
           usage by scanning the session records,
           and "USE.GRAPH" which graphs the usage.

        Interactive Commands

           4.0  -MAGNUM CAIS <CR>

                :DO CNT.USE

           4.1  :RUN USE.GRAPH   (may be run anytime after DO CNT.USE
                                        if days desired to be graphed
                                        only go through the next to last day
                                        counted.)

                Enter Starting Date for period desired (MM/DD/YY):  MM/DD/YY

                Enter no. of days in period: n

                Enter the file name for the REPORT: GPHmmn
                   where mm is 2 digit month and n is week no. (1 through 5)

        Crash-Recovery.

           If the system crashes, or a line is lost and unable to continue,
           take the following steps:

                Crash during CNT.USE -->  DO CNT.USE.RESTORE

                Crash during USE.GRAPH --> RUN USE.GRAPH with the last used
                                                parameters.
