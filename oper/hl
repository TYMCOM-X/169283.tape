	CURRENT PROJECT LIST -  UPDATED 1/22/73
	***************************************


1)  CRASH ANALYSIS
        STATUS:  ACTIVE
	CORE: 300 WORDS
	TIME: WEEK-MONTH
	CPU:  NONE
        REQ:  NOW

     WE DON'T CURRENTLY OBTAIN ENOUGH INFORMATION ON
MANY OF OUR NODE CRASHES, ESPECIALLY REMOTES.  EACH
POTENTIAL CRASH SITUATION MUST BE ANALYZED AND THE
INFORMATION NEEDED DETERMINED.  THEN CODE MUST BE
WRITTEN TO SAVE THIS INFORMATION AND CORE PUT ASIDE
TO HOLD IT.
	THIS WORK MAY BE FRAGMENTED.

2)  CRASH ANALYSIS COLLECTION
        DORMANT
	CORE: 50 WORDS
	TIME: COUPLE OF DAYS
	CPU:  VERY LITTLE
	REQ:  NEW SUPERVISOR

     WE ARE NOT ALWAYS AWARE OF ALL NODE CRASHES AND AT
TIMES A CRASH IS LOST BECAUSE INFORMATION IS SAVED ONLY FOR
THE LAST FOUR CRASHES IN A NODE.  IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE
THE NODE SHIP THIS INFORMATION TO A COLLECTION PROGRAM
(POSSIBLY THE SUPERVISOR).
	NO ESTIMATE FOR THE COLECTION PROGRAM CAN BE GIVEN UNTIL
WE KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW THIS IS TO BE DONE..

3)  SELF-CHECKSUMMING CODE
        HOLD
	CORE: 300 WORDS
        TIME: ONE MONTH EACH CODE
	CPU:  A LITTLE
	REQ:  A CHANGE TO THE SUPERVISOR
              A CHANGE TO THE ASSEMBLER

	THERE HAVE BEEN CASES OF A NODE GOING SLIGHTLY BAD AND
THEN SLOWLY DECAYING TO VERY BAD.  WE COULD CHECKSUM SMALL
PIECES OF THE NODE CODE SOMEWHERE IN THE SECOND LOGIC AND IF
WE FIND A BAD ROUTINE, REPORT IT TO THE SUPERVISOR.
	THIS WILL REQUIRE THE SUPERVISOR TO RECOGNIZE A NEW
MESSAGE TYPE FROM THE NODES AND A NEW ERROR TYPE ON THE LOGGER
RECORD.

        IMPLEMENTATION WILL TAKE ALOT OF PRESSURE OFF ITEM
4 WHICH HAS THEORETICAL PROBLEMS.

        SHOULD BE DONE IN PARALELL WITH OR AFTER ITEMS
46 AND 47.
4)  201-LINE RECORD VERIFICATION
	CORE: 30-300 WORDS
	TIME: COUPLE OF DAYS - MONTH
	CPU:  A LITTLE - A LOT
	REQ:  'NEIGHBOR TYPE' INFORMATION

	CHECKSUMS ON PHYSICAL RECORDS PASSED OVER 201 LINES
PROTECT US FROM LINE ERRORS DURING TRANSMITTION BUT SAY
NOTHING ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF THE INFORMATION ITSELF.
IT MAY EVEN BE THAT A RECORD, SENT BY A NODE, DOES NOT
CONTAIN WHAT THE NODE THINKS IT DOES.  WE HAVE CERTAINLY HAD
CRASHES CAUSED BY VERIFIED PHYSICAL RECORDS CONTAINING 0-LENGTH
LOGICAL RECORDS.
	THIS PROBLEM HAS TO BE THOUGHT OVER A BIT MORE BEFORE
WE DO ANYTHING.  SOME THINGS THAT MIGHT BE DONE:  A) CHECKSUMS
ON LOGICAL RECORDS  B) BETTER CHECKING OF THE CONTENTS OF A
RECORD WHEN IT IS CONSTRUCTED  C) BETTER ERROR RECOVERY WHILE
THE RECORD IS BEING TORN DOWN.
	THIS MAY REQUIRE SEVERAL RELEASES OF NODE CODE AND WOULD
BE FACILITATED BY "NEIGHBOR TYPE" INFORMATION.

5)  NEIGHBOR TYPE INFORMATION
	CORE: 100 WORDS
	TIME: WEEK
	CPU:  NONE
	REQ:  NONE (BUT HAVING THE SUPERVISOR CHECK COMPATABLITY
		WOULD BE NICE)

	WHEN A NODE IS ASSEMBLED, IT SHOULD HAVE ASSEMBLED INTO
IT WHAT TYPE OF NODE IT IS.  THIS WOULD INCLUDE SUCH
INFORMATION AS: A) IS IT A BASE, REMOTE, TYMCOM III; B) VERSION
OF 201-LINE LOGIC USED (THIS WOULD FACILITATE INCOMPATIBLE
RELEASES OF CODE); C) IS THIS NODE TO BE TRUSTED; ETC.
COMPATABILITY OF NEIGHBORING NODES COULD THEN BE CHECKED BY
THE SUPERVISOR AT TAKE OVER TIME.
	THIS WOULD EVENTUALLY REQUIRE A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO
THE SUPERVISOR BUT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL IN MAKING MANY OF THE
CHANGES DESCRIBED IN THIS LIST.

6)  GLOBAL BACKPRESSURE
	CORE: 200 WORDS
	TIME: COUPLE OF WEEKS
	CPU:  VERY LITTLE
	REQ:  NONE

	BACKPRESSURE IS CURRENTLY APPLIED ON A CHANNEL BY CHANNEL
BASIS.  THIS DOES NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT THE
ACTUAL LOAD ON THE NODE IS; WHETHER IT IS FALLING BEHIND START
BAUD SCANNING; HEAVY TRAFFIC ON A HIGH SPEED LINE; EXTENSIVE
COMMUNICATION WITH THE HOST (WITH THE SUPERVISOR DURING TAKE-
OVER); ETC.  EACH NODE SHOULD BE AWARE OF HOW BUSY
IT IS; WHETHER IT IS FALLING BEHIND ON CRITICAL TASKS;
AND WHAT ACTIONS IT CAN TAKE TO RELIEVE THE SITUATION.
	THIS WOULD REQUIRE SOME CHANGES IN THE COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN NODES.  FOR EXAMPLE IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO PUT A 
201-LINE INTO A MARK STATE WITHOUT RESETING IT TO TEMPOR-
ARILY ELIVIATE THE NEED TO PROCESS DATA ON THAT LINE.
7)  SPECIAL DATA CIRCUITS
	CORE: 100 WORDS
	TIME: MONTH
	CPU:  NONE
	REQ:  NEW SUPERVISOR

	WHEN WE KNOW THAT A CIRCUIT IS GOING TO BE USED TO
PASS DATA ONLY, IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO PASS CHARACTERS IN
BLOCKS WHICH DO NOT HAVE TO BE CHECKED FOR SPECIAL TYMNET
CHARACTERS.  THIS WOULD ELIMINATE A LOT OF PROCESSING AND
POSSIBLY ALLOW WHOLE PHYSICAL RECORDS TO BE PASSED ALONG
WITH VERY LITTLE WORK.  THIS COULD BE USED FOR MANY AUX
CIRCUITS:  TELECOPY, REMOTE LOAD/DUMP, THE DEBUGGER, ETC.
	THIS WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE CIRCUIT BE TORN DOWN THROUGH
THE SUPERVISOR CHANNELS.

8)  DYNAMIC CIRCUIT REROUTING
	CORE: 200 WORDS
	TIME: MONTH
	CPU:  NONE
	REQ:  NEW SUPERVISOR

	THE TIME HAS PROBABLY COME WHEN WE SHOULD CONSIDER 
REROUTING CIRCUITS WHEN THEY ARE BROKEN BECAUSE OF A LINE
OUT OR A NODE CRASH ON A PASSTHROUGH NODE.  THIS COULD BE
DONE IN MOST CASES WITH NO LOSS OF DATA THOUGH THERE WOULD
PROBABLY BE DELAY IN PROCESSING.

9)  MESSAGES
	CORE: 100 WORDS
	TIME: WEEK
	CPU:  NONE
	REQ:  A CHANGE TO THE SUPERVISOR

	THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MESSAGES IN THE SUPERVISOR
WHICH REALLY BELONG IN THE REMOTE BUT HAVE BEEN MOVED
BECAUSE OF LACK OF CORE IN THE REMOTE.  THESE SOMETIMES
USE A LOT OF CORE IN THE SUPERVISOR AND A LOT OF BAND WIDTH
IN THE SUPERVISORY CHANNELS.

10) MALICIOUS NODE PROTECTION
	CORE: 50 WORDS
	TIME: WEEK
	CPU:  NONE
	REQ:  'NEIGHBOR TYPE' INFORMATION

	WE NEED TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM NODES WHICH DO NOT
RESIDE ON COMPANY PROPERTY.
11) MESSAGE RATE REGULATION
        DORMANT
	CORE: 50 WORDS
	TIME: COUPLE OF DAYS
	CPU:  NONE
	REQ:  NONE

	WE HAVE DEFINATE CASES OF FAULTY DATA SETS EATING UP A
LARGE AMOUNT OF BUFFER SPACE AND CPU.  IF WE REGULATED THE
SPEED AT WHICH REMOTES GENERATED MESSAGES OVER PORTS AND 
DID SOME REASONABLE BUFFER CLEARING WHEN WE ANSWERED LINES,
WE WOULD ELEMINATE MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS.

12) NEW AND IMPROVED "BALL LOGIC"
        DORMANT
	CORE: 50 WORDS
	TIME: WEEK
	CPU:  NONE
	REQ:  CHANGES TO THE HOSTS

	THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT IMPROVING THE CONCEPT
AND RELIABILITY OF THE CURRENT BALL LOGIC AND SOME OF THE
PROJECTS DISCUSSED HERE MAY NEED SOME NEW IDEAS (E.G. DYNAMIC
REROUTING).
	THIS WILL CERTAINLY REQUIRE A NUMBER OF RELEASES OF THE
NODE CODE.

13) BETTER BUFFER LOGIC
        DORMANT
	CORE: 400 WORDS
	TIME: MONTH
	CPU:  NONE
	REQ:  NONE

	TYMCOM-III!  WE ARE DEFINATELY HAVING PROBLEMS WITH
THE BUFFER LOGIC IN NLM, SDC, OSU AND ALL TYMCOM-III NODES
WHICH DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE BACKPRESSURE.  UNFORTUNATELY, WE
REACH THE FULL CPU CAPACITY OF THE MACHINE BEFORE WE RUN
OUT OF BUFFER SPACE AND ARE GETTING A LARGE NUMBER OF START
BAUD CRASHES.  THE BUFFER LOGIC IN OTHER NODES IS NOT SO 
GREAT EITHER.

14) REMOTE LOADING/DUMPING
        DORMANT
	CORE: 150 WORDS
	TIME: COUPLE OF WEEKS
	CPU:  NONE (IF DONE AT A RESONABLE TIME)
	REQ:  NEW SUPERVISOR, DATA CIRCUITS, ?

        SEE ITEM 32

	THERE ARE MANY OBVIOUS ADVANTAGES TO BEING ABLE TO 
DO REMOTE LOADING AND DUMPING.  THE MOST IMPORTANT:

	   A) MORE POSITIVE CONTROL OVER WHEN AND WITH WHAT
	   A NODE GETS LOADED;  B) ABILITY TO SAVE REMOTE
	   CRASHES FOR ANALYSIS;  C) FASTER TURNAROUND
	   WHEN A NET CHANGE REQUIRES MORE THAN ONE RELEASE
	   BECAUSE OF INCOMPATABILITIES IN THE NODE CODE.
15) "BREAK TABLES"
	CORE: 50 WORDS
	TIME: WEEK
	CPU:  A LITTLE
	REQ:  CHANGES TO THE HOSTS

	THIS IS PRIMARILY A VISIBLE PERFORMANCE EFFECT.  PUT-
TING BREAK TABLES IN THE REMOTE WILL GET US INTO DEFERED
ECHO AT MORE OPPORTUNE TIMES.

16) "DATA LOSS" BALL
	CORE: 50 WORDS
	TIME: COUPLE OF DAYS
	CPU:  NONE
        REQ:  HOSTS HAVE TO BE READY TO GIVE DATA LOSS INT.

	WHEN WE ZAP A BUFFER OR LOSE DATA IN ANY WAY, WE
WOULD REPLACE IT WITH A "DATA LOSS" BALL WHICH WOULD REP-
RESENT TO THE TERMINAL NODES THAT A BLOCK OF DATA HAS BEEN
LOST AT THIS POINT.

17) SUPER COMMANDS
        HOLD
	CORE: NONE (NO NODE CODE INVOLVED)
	TIME: MONTH
	CPU:  NONE
	REQ:  NONE

	IT WOULD SEEM DESIRABLE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE COMMANDS
DIRECTLY TO THE SUPERVISOR.  THE CURRENT METHOD OF DOING
LINE-SHUTS COULD BE IMPROVED.  IT WOULD ALSO BE NICE
TO PREVENT PERSONS NOT ON THE PROJECT FROM CHANGING NODE
CODE THROUGH THE SUPERVISOR DEBUGGER BY ALLOWING THEM
(IF THEY ARE AUTHORIZED) TO TELL THE SUPERVISOR DIRECTLY.
	A USER PROGRAM COULD BE WRITTEN WHICH ACCEPTED COMMANDS
TO THE SUPERVISOR, CONVERTED THEM TO MEANINGFUL SUPERVISOR
COMMANDS, AND TRANSMITTED THEM TO THE SUPERVISOR THROUGH
A SHARED PAGE.

        NEXT STEP IS TO FIND OUT WHAT FUNCTIONS OPERATIONS
(AND PRODUCT SUPPORT?) NEED (WANT) TO BE ABLE TO DO.

18) BETTER 620 DEBUGGER
        DORMANT
	CORE: 100 WORDS
	TIME: WEEK
	CPU:  NONE
	REQ:  NEW SUPERVISOR, DATA CIRCUITS

	THE CURRENT METHOD OF DEBUGGING NODE CODE IS NOT
ADEQUATE.  WE NEED A BETTER HANDLE ON THIS FUNCTION.  IT
WOULD ALSO MAKE SENSE TO RUN THE DEBUGGER AS A USER PROGRAM.
	NO ESTIMATED IS GIVEN ON THE NEW DEBUGGER.

19) REDESIGN THE MIC INTERFACE
        HOLD
	CORE: NONE
	TIME: WEEK
	CPU:  NONE
	REQ:  CHANGES TO THE HOSTS

	WE COULD SAVE SOME PROCESSING TIME IN THE HOSTS (THE PDP-10
IN PARTICULAR) AND THE BASES BY COMING UP WITH A NEW MIC INTERFACE.
	THIS SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE WE SPECIFY THE 370 INTERFACE.
20) REDESIGN THE SPECIAL TYMNET CHARACTERS
        RECONSIDERATION
	CORE: 50 WORDS
	TIME: COUPLE OF WEEKS
	CPU:  NONE
	REQ:  CHANGES TO THE HOSTS

	THE USE OF THE CONTROL CHARACTERS 0-7 ASCII AS SPECIAL
TYMNET CHARACTERS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A POOR CHOICE.  THESE
ARE FREQUENTLY USED CHARACTERS AND CAUSE A LOT OF SPECIAL
PROCESSING BOTH IN THE NET AND IN THE HOST EVERY TIME ONE
IS USED.

        I SUGGEST WE ABORT THIS PROJECT.  PROCESSING IN THE
HOST WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF BY ITEM 19. WITHIN TYMNET, THIS
LOOKS LIKE AN ALL-NODES-AT-ONCE CHANGE THAT AFFECTS MANY
MANY ROUTINES IN EACH CODE.  AGREED THAT WE SUFFER FROM THE
POOR INITIAL CHOICE.

21) READ "TERMINAL CHARACTERISTICS"
        DORMANT
	CORE: 20 WORDS
	TIME: COUPLE OF DAYS
	CPU:  NONE
	REQ:  NONE

	IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO BE ABLE TO READ "TERMINAL
CHARACTERISTICS", FROM THE REMOTE, BOTH IN OTHER NODES AND
IN THE HOST.

        NEXT STEP IS TO SPECIFY MSG FORMAT FOR QUERY
AND RESPONSE.

22) ELIMINATE "START BAUD" CRASHES
        PAUL.  IN PROGRESS.
        CORE: INITIALLY 100 WORDS  28 JAN 73 PMD.
	TIME: COUPLE OF WEEKS
	CPU:  NONE
        REQ:

	WE CAN ELEMINATE START BAUD CRASHES BY RUNNING THE
THE START BAUD SCANNER AT A PSEUDO-INTERRUPT LEVEL BELOW
THE 201 CLEANUP LOGIC.  THE SCANNER WILL PLACE THE CHARACTERS
IN A RING BUFFER ALONG WITH THE PORT NUMBER.  THE RECEIVER
/TRANSMITER LOGIC, WHICH IS CURRENTLY PART OF THE SCANNER,
WOULD THEN BE RUN AS THEY ARE NOW BUT WOULD TAKE THE 
CHARACTERS OUT OF THE RING BUFFER.  NOW, INSTEAD OF START
BAUD CRASHES, WE WOULD OCCASIONALLY LOSE CHARACTERS IN THE
RING BUFFER.  THIS WOULD, HOWEVER, BE LESS FREQUENT
(IF AT ALL).

23) STATISTICS GATHERING
	CORE: 100 WORDS
	TIME: COUPLE OF WEEKS
	CPU:  A LITTLE
	REQ:  NONE

	WE CAPTURE NO DATA ON HOW MUCH TRAFFIC IS PASSING
THROUGH ANY NODE;  ALL WE CAN TELL IS HOW MANY CIRCUITS ARE
ASSIGNED.  WHEN EVERY CIRCUIT WENT FROM A MODEL 33 TO A
940, PERHAPS REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS COULD BE MADE FROM
NUMBER OF CIRCUITS IN THE WORLD.  BUT NOWADAYS WE'RE SERVICING
A LOT OF AUXILARY CIRCUITS AND TYMCOM-III'S.  I SUSPECT NLM OF
HAVING VERY NASTY OUTPUT CHARACTERISTICS--LOOK AT THE NUMBER
OF START BAUD SCANNER CRASHES IN WAS2 SINCE THEY GOT ALL 30
PORTS WORKING.  IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL BOTH IN CRASH
ANALYSIS AND IN LONG AND SHORT TERM DESIGN OF SOFTWARE AND
HARDWARE TO HAVE SOME DECENT IDEA OF WHAT LOADS WE'RE
CARRYING.
24) STATISTICS COLLECTION
	CORE: 50 WORDS
	TIME: COUPLE OF DAYS
	CPU:  A LITTLE
	REQ:  NEW SUPERVISOR

	THIS IS ON THE SAME IDEA AS 'CRASH ANALYSIS COLLECTION'.

25) LOST CIRCUIT ZAPPERS
	CORE: 30 WORDS
	TIME: COUPLE OF DAYS
	CPU:  NONE
        REQ:  NOW

	WE'VE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED ONE CAUSE OF ALL THE 
DOUBLED-UP CIRCUITS WE'VE BEEN SEEING LATELY:  THE ZAPPER
FOR THE OLD CIRCUIT DOESN'T GET OUTA TOWN BEFORE WE ANSWER
THE LINE AGAIN.  SINCE THERE IS NO (REASONABLE) TIME BY
WHICH WE CAN GUARANTEE THE ZAPPER WILL HAVE BEEN PROCESSED,
WE NEED AN INTERLOCK SET AT HANG TIME AND CLEARED BY THE
ZAPPER PROCESSOR IN RMAKE (RM17).  THIS LOCK WOULD BECOME
AN ELEMENT OF THE ANSWER EQUATIONS.

26) NEW 201 LINE POLLING TECHNIQUE
	CORE: 50 WORDS
	TIME: WEEK
	CPU:  A LITTLE
        REQ:  NOW

	A PARTIAL CAUSE OF THE ZAPPERS NOT MOVING OUT IN A 
TIMELY FASHION MAY BE OUR CURIOUS LINE POLLING ALGORITHM:
EACH TIME RMAKE IS ENTERED, IT MAKES UP EXACTLY ZERO OR ONE
OUTGOING RECORDS, AND IT ALWAYS STARTS LOOKING FOR WORK FOR
THE HIGHEST NUMBERED LINE FIRST.  THEREFORE, UNDER VERY 
HEAVY LOADS, WHEN THE 201 LINE SERVICE STARTS DEGRADING, 
SERVICE ON LINE 0 DEGRADES THE MOST.  (IF NO RECORD IS MADE
FOR 16 SECONDS, THE LINE IS OUT AND THE CIRCUITS ARE ZAPPED.
WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS HAS OR HAS NOT HAPPENED,
NOR DO WE HAVE ANY VERY GOOD IDEAS HOW TO FIND OUT.)  IT IS
PERHAPS INTERESTING TO NOTE IN PASSING THAT THE HIGHEST
SPEED LINE ON ANY NODE MUST BE LINE ZERO.  WE SHOULD CHANGE
THE LINE POLLING ALGORITHM TO A MODIFIED ROUND ROBIN.
	EVEN IF THERE ARE NO SOLID BUGS CAUSED BY THIS, THERE ARE
CERTAINLY PERFORMANCE ANOMALIES (LIKE FINDING IT'S VERY HARD TO GET
OUT OF DEFERRED ECHO) WHEN THE LOAD GETS HEAVY IN PARTS OF THE NET.

        SUB PROJECTS:
        A)  BASES
        B)  REMOTES

27) AUX CIRCUITS PDP-10: (NO ESTIMATES)
        DORMANT

28) SUPERVISORY BUFFER ZAPS
	CORE: 50 WORDS
	TIME: COUPLE OF DAYS
	CPU:  A LITTLE
        REQ:  NOW

	WE ARE CURRENTLY ALLOWING SUPERVISORY BUFFERS TO BE
ZAPPED.  THIS IS BAD, IF THE NODE HAS AN UPSTREAM DIRECTION.

29) NEW SUPERVISOR: (NO ESTIMATES)
30)  RE-WRITE TYMCOM III
     CORE:  NONE
     TIME:  3 MONTHS
     CPU:   SOME
     REQ:   NONE

     A REWRITE OF TYMCOM III WILL PROVIDE FOR A RELIABLE
     SYSTEM AND MAKE FUTURE NEW INSTALLATIONS EASIER.

     HOLD
31)  NEW MACHINE
     TIME:  1-2 MM (SPECIFICATION)
     CPU:
     REQ:  NOW

     WE NEED TO SPECIFY A NEW MACHINE.  THE MOST IMPORTANT
     FEATURE IS RELIABILITY.  THREE YEAR MEAN TIME TO UNDETECTED
     FAILURE.

     WE ARE CONSIDERING AN INSTRUCTION SET ADAPTED FROM BELL &
     NEWELL'S PROPOSAL FOR AN 8-BIT-CHARACTER COMPUTER.  SEE
     WM FOR XEROX COPIES OF THE B&N PAPER, AND OUR PROPOSED
     INST. SET.

32)  CASSETTE DUMP/LOAD
     HOLD
     CORE:  100 WORDS
     TIME:  1-2 WEEKS
     CPU:   SOME
     REQ:   HARDWARE, DATA CIRCUITS (ITEM 7)

     SEE ITEM 14

     WE NEED THE ABILITY TO DUMP CRASHES, LOAD CODE, AND
     DISTRIBUTE NEW CODE.  A DEVICE SUCH AS A CASSETTE
     WOULD BE A MAJOR HELP.

33)  HARDWARE CHARACTER ASSEMBLY
     GROUP.  ACTIVE SOFTWARE DESIGN AND HARDWARE SPEC
     CORE:  SAVE 2K
     TIME:  1 WEEK
     CPU:   REGAIN 40% (ON A 1.8 MIC MACHINE)
     REQ:   HARDWARE

     HARDWARE CHARACTER ASSEMBLY WILL SAVE CPU, CORE AND
     ALLOW HIGH SPEED ASYCHRONOUS INPUT (1200 BAUD).  IT
     ALSO GREATLY SIMPLIFIES THE REAL TIME CODING PROBLEMS
     WHICH WILL MAKE IT MUCH EASIER TO WRITE AND DEBUG CODE.

     NOTE NEW CORE ESTIMATE 25 JAN 73

34)  370 BASE
     ACTIVE
     CORE:  12K
     TIME:  1 MONTH
     CPU:   1.0 MIC
     REQ:   NONE

     PROVIDE A BASICALLY STANDARD BASE FOR THE 370.
	CF. ITEM 19
     MUST RESPOND TO LAROY PROPOSAL.

35)  MDSI
     DORMANT
     CORE:  NONE
     TIME:  1 WEEK
     CPU:   NONE
     REQ:   NONE

     MAKE SUPERVISOR AND BASE NODES NECESSARY FOR 64 USERS.

     I THINK ALL WE NEED DO IS VERIFY THAT THERE IS NOTHING
     TO DO.  WM 28 JAN 73

36)  PARIS
     HLS.  DEFINE THE PROBLEM
     CORE:  MAY REQUIRE 12K
     CPU:   LITTLE
     REQ:   SURROUNDING NODES
     TIME:  1-2 MONTHS
     ANALYZE THE PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH THE TA LINE AND RUN
     SUPERVISOR #4 IN PARIS.

37)  NETWORK RECONFIGURATION
     STATUS:  ACTIVE  WALT.  PROGRESS HALTINGLY.
     MACHINE:  VARIOUS 940 AND 10 PROGRAMS.  MAY TAKE A LOT
     OF FILE SPACE ON VARIOUS MACHINES.
     TIME:  1-2 MAN MONTHS
     REQ:   NOW

     SUBPROJECTS:
     A)  ANAL. OF NET LOADING BY CIRCUIT-LEVEL SIMULATION
     AND SNAPSHOT DATA.
     B)  CHARACTERIZATION OF SESSIONS BY MACHINE, TERMINAL,
     SOURCE, ETC.  RAW DATA WILL BE FURNISHED BY ACCOUNTING.

38)  SNAPSHOT PROGRAM
     STATUS:  ACTIVE  BRYAN.  IMPROVEMENTS CONTINUALLY.
     NEXT RELEASE 1 FE     MACHINE:  INDEPENDENT 940 PROGRAM
     TIME:  2-3 WEEKS
     REQ:   NOW

     ADD A ROUTINE TO PRINT TIME AND DATE OF SNAP.
     ADD A COMMAND TO CHANGE THE OUTPUT FILE. (DONE)
     ADD XACT (EXCEPTIONAL CONDITIONS)
     ADD AC (ACT OVER ALL NODES)
     ADD GENERALIZED ACB (NODES NOT NECESSARILY ADJACENT)
     ADD ACP (ALL CIRCUITS PASSING THROUGH A GIVEN NODE)
     ADD ACA (ALL CIRCUITS IN A GIVEN NODE)

39)  SHELL-1108 LINK
     DORMANT.  NO SPEC.
     CORE: 4K
     TIME:  1 MONTH
     CPU:   MAY REQUIRE 1.0 MIC
     REQ:   NONE

     INTEGRATE 1108 INTERFACE INTO BASE CODE.

42)  ALLOW THE SUPERVISOR TO DO MULTIPLE DISC READS ON EACH
     DISPATCHING CYCLE IN ORDER TO RELEIVE LONG LOGIN QUEUES
     DURING PEAK PERIODS.

43)  WHEN THE SUPERVISOR CRASHES SAVE THE PAGES IN CORE
     PLUS THE PARAMETER TABLE PAGES.  THIS WILL HELP GREATLY
     (INSTEAD OF AN ARBITRARY COLLECTION OF PAGES) IN ANALYZING
     CRASHES.

44)  A PROGRAM TO TAKE SUPER CRASHES AND SAVE THEM IN A FILE.
     IN THIS WAY CRASHES CAN BE EASILY SAVED SO THAT THEY AREN'T
     LOST IF THE SUPER CRASHES AGAIN.  POSSIBILITY OF SOMEHOW 
     AUTOMATICALLY INITIATING THIS PROGRAM WHEN SUPER CRASHES.

45)  AT PRESENT TIME WHEN A TIMEOUT OCCURS DURING LOGIN, THE
     ENTRY IS REMOVED FROM THE LOGIN LIST BUT NOT FROM THE 
     DISK READ QUEUE.  THEREFORE DURING HIGH LOADS WHEN WE HAVE
     A LOT OF PEOPLE TIMING OUT BECAUSE THE QUEUES ARE SO
     LONG WE DO NOTHING TO RELEIVE THE LOAD.  WE STILL DO ALL
     THE DISK READS.  WE SHOULD REMOVE THE ENTRY FROM THE DISK
     QUEUE AT THE SAME TIME WE REMOVE IT FROM THE LOGIN LIST.
