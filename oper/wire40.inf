** These commands are the various functional units:  essentially
independent processes which may be performed.  Each of these commands
expects the additional text in the command: USING filename.  The file
named may be a command file for BOARD, a plug library for PLUG, or
an existing data-base for the other commands.

   In addition, once any of the functional units have been entered,
the commands ? or HELP will no longer provide this set of messages,
but will instead list the commands appropriate to that functional unit.
Repeating the help (or ?) immediately will then give the basic set
of messages.

CAPABILITIES:

        WIRRAP is used to manipulate and document divers information
relating to "wire-wrap" circuit boards.  One set of information concerns
plug libraries, which may be concerned with integrated circuits, cards,
and/or cables.  A plug library may be generated, edited, and updated
using the PLUG function of WIRRAP.  A data-base may be generated--
along with drilling information for manufacturing--describing a
given board configuration, using the BOARD function.  this data-base
may then be used to create, document, and modify a complete description
of the wiring to be placed on that board.

INSTRUCTIONS:

        WIRRAP is an interactive process which tells the user if he
is doing something wrong.  by typing a sequence of COMMANDS, each
with its list of attributes, he describes boards, plugs, and wiring.

        At any time, a user may type HELP to determine what options 
he has open to him.  These options vary, depending on the function
that WIRRAP is currently engaged in.  As a result, it is suggested
the command:

   HELP (or ?)

be typed, to determine what to do next.
