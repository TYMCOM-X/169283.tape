THIS NEWS FILE DESCRIBES THE ADDED CAPABILITIES IN XBASIC.  THIS VER-
SION IS CURRENTLY INSTALLED AS LBASIC ON ALL TYMCOM X SYSTEMS.  IN
ADDITION TO THE CAPABILITIES DESCRIBED BELOW,  THIS VERSION INCLUDES
THE ACCESS OF PROGRAMS ACROSS USER BOUNDARIES WITH USERNAMES AND THE
LOCK COMMAND.  PLEASE CHECK THIS VERSION CAREFULLY AND REPORT ANY
PROBLEMS TO MARKETING SUPPORT.  WE WILL INFORM YOU WHEN LBASIC IS
SCHEDULED TO DISAPPEAR AND REPLACE XBASIC.



EXTENSIONS TO MAT IO STATEMENTS

[CS] SHALL MEAN CHANNEL SPECIFIER SUCH AS #1 OR :3 AND
[VS] SHALL MEAN SEQUENCE OF LIST OR ARRAY TYPE VARIABLES 
  SUCH AS A,B,C$ ETC WHERE A,B, AND C$ HAVE BEEN DECLARED IN A DIM
 STATEMENT- IF NOT DECLARED THE MAX. SUBSCRIPT WILL BE TAKEN TO BE 10.

A) MAT READ [CS],[VS]
        USED FOR READING  SEQUENTIAL ACCESS FILES WITH LINE NOS OR
        FOR RANDOM ACCESS FILES.
        E.G.    MAT READ #1,A,B,C$
                MAT READ :3,A(2)

B) MAT INPUT [CS],[VS]
        USED FOR READING SEQUENTIAL ACCESS FILES WITHOUT LINE NOS OR
        RANDOM ACCESS FILES
        E.G.    MAT INPUT #1,B
                MAT INPUT :3,X$(4)

C) MAT WRITE [CS],[VS]
        USED FOR OUTPUTTING TO SEQUENTIAL ACCESS FILES WITH LINE 
        NOS OR TO RANDOM ACCESS FILES
        E.G.    MAT WRITE #2,C
                MAT WRITE :3,S

D) MAT PRINT [CS],[VS]
        USED FOR OUTPUTTING TO SEQUENTIAL ACCESS FILES WITHOUT LINE
        NOS OR TO RANDOM ACCESS FILES
        E.G.    MAT PRINT #5,A,B,C
                MAT PRINT :8,N$




IN THE FOLLOWING NEW STATEMENTS
[CS] SHALL MEAN A CHANNEL SPECIFIER SUCH AS #DIGIT ONLY
(NO RANDOM ACCESS) AND
[VS] SHALL MEAN A SEQUENCE OF NUMERIC VALUED LIST OR ARRAY TYPE 
VARIABLES
  OR
 A SEQUENCE OF STRING VALUED LIST OR ARRAY TYPE VARIABLES
BUT NOT MIXED
        E.G. A,B,C
             A$,B$,C$(5)

E) MAT WRITE [CS],USING [LINE NO./STRING FORMULA],[VS]
        OR
   MAT WRITE USING [CS],[LINE NO./STRING FORMULA],[VS]
        CAUSES DATA TO BE OUTPUT TO LINE NUMBERED SEQUENTIAL ACCESS
        FILE IN FORMAT SPECIFIED. 
        E.G.    MAT WRITE #1,USING 220,A$,B$,D$
                MAT WRITE USING #3,"### ###",A
                MAT WRITE #5,USING B$,A,B,C

F) MAT PRINT [CS],USING [LINE NO./STRING FORMULA],[VS]
    MAT PRINT USING [CS],[LINE NO./STRING FORMULA],[VS]
        SAME AS ABOVE EXCEPT DATA IS OUTPUT
        TO SEQUENTIAL ACCESS FILE WITHOUT LINE NOS.

G) IN THE TWO EXAMPLES ABOVE THE CHANNEL SPECIFIER MAY BE OMITTED
   IN WHICH CASE OUTPUT WILL0GO TO THE TELETYPE
        E.G.    MAT PRINT USING 300,A,B(5)
                MAT PRINT USING B$,C
                MAT PRINT USING"###",B(3)
