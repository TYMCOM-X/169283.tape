                              PROGRAM ACCESS



Programs whose names are underlined may be executed simply by typing their
name  followed by a carrage return at Tymex command level signified by the
'-'.

For example:
          -CFORTRAN<CR>


Program names which are not underlined may be accessed in any  of  several
ways depending on the type of file or program that is desired.  Executable
programs are accessed by typing one of the following:

          -R STATPAK<CR>

          RUN (program location)program name

          i.e., -RUN (UPL)FASBOL<CR>


BASIC Programs

Some programs are stored in 'source' or 'symbolic' form rather than  'RUN'
form.   BASIC programs are of this type and are denoted by '(BASIC)' being
included in the program description.  To run one of these  programs,  such
as ECOLOGY, do the following:

          BASIC
          OLD
          SYS:ECOLOGY
          RUN

Note that 'SYS:' must precede the name of the program to indicate that the
program  is  stored  on  the  system  library.  If the program were stored
somewhere else, the 'SYS:' would be replaced by '(program location)', e.g.
'(UPL)'.

To return to Tymex command level after execution of the program, type  the
command 'SYSTEM' followed by a carriage return.


Subroutine Libraries

To access  subroutine  libraries,  such  as  ZLIB,  you  can  include  the
following with any complie class command.

                         SUPPORT CLASSIFICATION

The following is a description of the support  code  assigned  to  various
programs  on  the  Tymcom  X  system.   Please note that there are several
classifications formulated in the following manner:

          1) the numeral represents  the  support  organization  which  is
          responsible  for maintaining the software.  there are four basic
          classifications; Tymshare, Royalty, Contributed, Vendor.

          2) the letter following  the  number  represents  the  level  of
          activity which may be expected and the current support condition
          of the software.

Class 1        Tymshare software
Class 2        Royalty Software
Class 3        Contributed software
Class 4        Vendor supplied Software

      a        This classification indicates the software is  for  general
               use  and the needs of the users determines the direction of
               future development and support.  The software is considered
               to be active and currently supported such that bugs will be
               fixed and new features implemented as the demand arises.

      b        This classification indicates the software is for  Tymshare
               use  primarily  and  the  needs  of Tymshare determines the
               direction of future development and support.  The  software
               is  considered  to  be  active and currently supported such
               that bugs will be fixed and new features implemented as the
               demand arises.

      c        This classification indicates the software was developed by
               a  royalty  vendor  or donated by a vendor and is currently
               available for all users.  This classification implies  that
               the software is currently supported by Tymshare and bugs or
               new features  not  provided  through  the  vendor  will  be
               implemented as the demand arises by Tymshare

      d        This classification indicates  the  software  is  currently
               available   for   general   use  and  that  the  supporting
               organization is currently doing development on the product.
               New  features and bug fixes will be provided in forthcoming
               releases.

      e        This classification is provided for software which  is  not
               currently supported in a maintenance state but is available
               for general use.  The reason  for  non-maintenance  support
               may  be due to the absence of sources from which to provide
               maintenance or that the software is being replaced by other
               new software.

      f        This classification is provided for non-supported  software
               that  is not maintained on the system but is available upon
               request for user examination and modification.
