Magnum Execution
================

General rules for execution:

        All user input must be terminated with a carriage return

        MAGNUM prompts for commands with a colon ':'

        Invoke MAGNUM for schema TYCOMAN:
                -MAGNUM TYCOMAN

        MAGNUM command errors are signalled by a '?',
            optionally followed by an error number.  To obtain an
            explanation of why an error was diagnosed, the user should
            use the WHY command, followed by the error number given,
            if any:
                :WHY <error number>

        When the user is first gaining familiarity with MAGNUM, it is
            helpful to enter the command switch NOVICE to obtain
            maximum diagnostic information.  (This switch can subsequently       
            be suppressed by the countermand EXPERT.)
                :NOVICE

        If desired, data base control may be used at this point to
            protect previously created relations.  The user uses the
            BACKUP command to protect a specific relation.
                :BACKUP <relation name>

        Use the RUN command to perform a particular Tymshare Commission
            procedure:
                :RUN <procedure name>

            Valid procedure names:
                DEF.AREA            Area Identification
                DEF.DISTRICT        District Identification
                DEF.EMPLOYEE        Employee Identification
                DEF.SALES.TYPE      Sales Personnel Identification
                DEF.COM.PLAN        Commission Plans
                REVENUE             Monthly Service Revenue
                ADJUSTMENTS         Monthly Manual Adjustments
                PRODUCTS            Monthly Product Revenue
                CHARGEBACKS         Monthly Chargebacks
                ATM.AC.COM.UPD      ATM/AC Year-to-date Commission
                BM.DM.SR.COM.UPD    BM/DM/SR Year-to-date Commission
                ATM.COM.RPT         Area Technical Manager Commission Report
                AC.COM.RPT          Applications Consultant Commission Report
                DM.COM.RPT          District Manager Commission Report
                BM.COM.RPT          Branch   Manager Commission Report
                SR.COM.RPT          Sales Representative Commission Report

        MAGNUM initiates processing of a valid procedure:
                LOADING <procedure name>
                EXECUTION

        Some procedures will require the user to identify the year and
            month for which the data is to be associated (processing
            period).  The procedure will request this information in the
            form YY,MM (both two-digit numeric fields indicating year
            within century and month within year, respectively)
            and then redisplay this information to the user
            for verification, to which the user may reply yes or no
            (Y or N).  Please note that the processing period is not
            necessarily related to the current calendar date; typically
            the processing period will be for the previous calendar
            month.  The user must take care to assure entry of the
            correct year and month, because otherwise errors will result
            from alterations to data for the wrong period.

        MAGNUM will prompt for the name of a user-designated report file
            (output listing).  If a separate report is not desired, reply
            TERMINAL (or any truncated abbreviation of the word TERMINAL
            containing at least 3 characters, such as TER).
                Enter the file name for the REPORT: <report file>

        Similarly, MAGNUM will request the name of a user-designated
            source file (input list) if required by the procedure.  Again
            the user may reply TERMINAL (or any truncated abbreviation of
            at least 3 characters).  Terminal input is ended by typing
            & for any prompt.

        MAGNUM notes the completion of a procedure:
                EXECUTION COMPLETED

        Another MAGNUM command may now be entered.  For example, if 
            if the BACKUP command had been used to preserve any files
            before possible alteration by the procedure just executed,
            and the procedure terminated as expected, the user will
            want to delete each former copy with the DELETE command:
                :DELETE <relation name> BACKUP

        Alternately, if the procedure executed abnormally or incorrect
            data were used, the user will want to re-establish the original
            state of each affected relation with the RESTORE command:
                :RESTORE <relation name> RELEASE

        If no further work is to be done, the user may return to the monitor
            by typing QUIT.
                :QUIT


        (Further information about the use of MAGNUM appears in the
            MAGNUM Reference Manual.)

Magnum Free-form Input
======================

General Rules for free-form Magnum input:
data types:  character, numeric, date

    1.  Items must be separated by commas:
                ABC,12489,van Gogh

    2.  Commas themselves may not appear as input items unless
        included between pairs of double or single quotation marks:
                E,75,'Tymshare, Inc.',20705
                1970.06,A/B,"Trafikrestauranger, Tysklandkaj"

    3.  A single quote used as an apostrophe in a
        character field causes no problem:
                1740,Place de l'Enfant,DC20036

    4.  Commas should not be used to separate digits
        within a number; a decimal point, currency sign, positive-
        negative sign, etc. are acceptable if allowance has been
        made beforehand in MAGNUM procedures or schema for their
        presence:
                -32767.99,INF

    5.  If decimal positions have been provided for in a numeric field
        but a particular value has no decimal data, the decimal point and
        following zero(s) may be omitted.
                40137,40125  ==  40137.00,40124.00

    6.  Leading or trailing blanks are ignored for all data types;
        for character fields, intermediate blanks are retained, and
        leading or trailing blanks may be included by enclosing the
        the entire field in single or double quotation marks.

    7.  A double quote alone in a field causes the corresponding
        field value of the previous line to be duplicated:
                ADD,12377,Conrad,ENGR1
                ",12316,Williams,MAINT
                ",12193,Forest,"

    8.  Missing fields cause default values (determined within MAGNUM
        procedures or schema) to be inserted:
                75,,  ==  75,[2nd field default value],[3rd field default value]

    9.  A slash alone in a field causes all remaining input fields in
        that line to assume default values:
                ICHING,/  ==  ICHING,,,,,,
