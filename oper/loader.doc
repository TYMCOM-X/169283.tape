2.0 EXTERNAL CHANGES

 #127   SPR 8583
        MONLOD only
        MONLOD ignores [PPN] for .XPN file.
        Fix: Use [PPN] if given.

 #131   DMN
        It  is  not  possible  to  load  code  generated  by
        FORTRAN-10 with that generated by F40.
        Fix: Test for this and output
        ?CANNOT LOAD BOTH F40 AND FORTRAN-10 COMPILED CODE

 #134   SPR 9293
        No message  given  if  ALGOL  stand-alone  procedure
        loaded without ALGOL main progran.
        Fix: Output message
        ?ALGOL MAIN PROGRAM NOT LOADED

 #135   DMN
        It is not possible to load FORTRAN-10 code generated
        for KA10 with that for KI10
        Fix: Test for this and output message
        ?CANNOT MIX KA-10 AND KI-10 FORTRAN-10 COMPILED CODE

 #142   DMN
        FORTRAN-10 needs to be able to produce  two  segment
        code  to  load in one segment, but the length of the
        high segment is not known in time.
        Fix, output the origin and length of the low segment
        as an optional second word of block type 3.

 #143   SPR 9625
        Programs that are an exact multiple  of  1k  end  up
        with a high segment 1k too small in some cases.
        Fix, add more code at REMAP uuo.

 #144   SPR 9634
        Suppressed symbols reappear.
        Fix, correct bad edit in 56A.

 #145   DMN
        Make FOROTS the default Fortran object  time  system
        by setting assembly switch FORSW==2.

5.0 INTERNAL CHANGES

 #130   DMN
        FORTRAN-10 needs polish block (type 11) to calculate
        offsets  to  some  arrays  (where the address of the
        array plus offset looks like  it  would  be  in  the
        wrong segment).
        Fix: Turn on switch B11SW which assembles block type
        11 code.

 #132   DMN
        COMMON allocation (block type 20) in a  two  segment
        program relocates to wrong segment.
        Fix: Test for  high  segment  and  relocate  to  low
        segment.

 #133   DMN
        Block type 21 fails.
        Fix: Add missing code.

 #136   BBN
        Add code under IFN  TENEX  to  assemble  version  of
        loader  to run under TENEX.  The TENEX switch is set
        zero in the DEC official loader.

 #137   DMN
        Fix #135 for FORTRAN-10 KA/KI code.

 #140   DMN
        Fix bug in block type 21 if symbol is common.

 #141   DMN
        More fixes for #135
