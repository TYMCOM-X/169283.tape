                                        (REF: A.G.2.29)

I ADDED A NEW DEBUGGING AID TO TYMEX.  THIS GOODIE WILL LET YOU TELL
TYMEX TO RUN A SPECIFIC PROGRAM AFTER IT DOES ITS STUFF INSTEAD OF THE
SYSTEM PROGRAM WHICH IT WILL NORMALLY RUN.  THIS CAN BE DONE WITH ANY
TYMEX COMMAND WHICH ACCEPTS ANY SWITCHES (ALL COMMANDS WHICH RUN
OTHER PROGRAMS EXCEPT COPY).

YOU GET AT THIS MARVELOUS FEATURE BY INCLUDING THE SWITCH
/RUN <FILENAME>
IN THE COMMAND, WHERE <FILENAME> IS THE USUAL DEVICE-USER-FILE-EXT-PPN
THING.  THE DEFAULT DEVICE IS DSK AND THE DEFAULT PPN IS THE USER'S
DIRECTORY.

EXAMPLES:

TO TEST A NEW LISTER IN YOUR DIRECTORY:
-LIST /RUN LISTER /SMALL UHCLEM.HTD

TO TEST A DEBUGGING VERSION OF BLISS IN USER BLISS:
-COM TEST1,(BARNEY)BOZO /RUN(BLISS)BLIDEB

ONE CAUTION: THE USE OF THIS SWITCH CAN CAUSE SOME CONFUSION IF IT
US GIVEN IN A LOAD-TYPE COMMAND WHICH RUNS SEVERAL PROCESSORS,
AND YOU PROBABLY WON'T GET ALL YOUR FILES COMPILED PROPERLY.



THE DIFFERENCES COMMAND WHICH RUNS FILCOM TO COMPARE TWO FILES HAS BEEN
ADDED.  SEE FILCOM.INF FOR DETAILS.
CHANGES IN TYMEX VERSION 107.2:

I DELETED THE DEC PART OF THE VERSION NUMBER (13.0) SINCE DEC'S TYMEX
AND OURS ARE ONLY DISTANTLY RELATED NOW.

-FI/TOD AND -FI FOO_ NOW WORK PROPERLY.

THE COPY COMMAND ACCEPTS COMMAND FILES.  THE COMMAND FILE SHOULD
BE A SERIES OF NAME PAIRS LIKE THIS:
A,B
C TO D
E,F
ETC.

THE DIFFERENCES COMMAND WILL ACCEPT SWITCHES ANYWHERE, NOT JUST AT THE
END OF THE COMMAND.

THE /REL SWITCH REALLY WORKS NOW.  LAST TIME IT DIDN'T, BUT YOU
CAN BELIEVE ME THIS TIME, GEORGE, BECAUSE THIS ONE ISN'T LIKE THE
AUSTRALIAN SELF-SHARPENING SCISSORS.

ANOTHER NEW DEBUGGING AID: THE COMMAND

-CTEST SETTYMEX <FILENAME>

WILL CAUSE THE GIVEN FILE TO BE RUN FOR TYMEX COMMANDS INSTEAD
OF SYS:TYMEX.  THIS IS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH A NEW PARAMETER FILE,
TMPCOR:TYMEX OR DSK:###TYMEX.TMP, WHICH MAY EVENTUALLY CONTAIN ALL KINDS OF
GOODIES.  RIGHT NOW IT CONTAINS ONLY AN ENTRY FOR THIS SPECIAL
ACTION.  AFTER THE COMMAND IS GIVEN, THE MONITOR WILL STILL CALL
SYS:TYMEX FOR TYMEX COMMANDS, BUT SYS:TYMEX WILL CHECK THE PARAMETER FILE AND
RUN THE SPECIFIED FILE TO HANDLE THE COMMAND.
-CTEST SETTYMEX<CR> WILL RESTORE THE NORMAL ACTION OF USING SYS:TYMEX.
FOR THIS FEATURE TO WORK, SYS:TYMEX MUST BE VERSION 107.2 OR LATER.

THE TYMEXDB DEBUGGING AID NO LONGER EXISTS.  IT HAS BEEN REPLACED BY
THE BLISS PROGRAM TC.  THE FILE TYMEX.CMD SHOWS HOW TYMEX AND TC ARE
LOADED TOGETHER TO MAKE A DEBUG VERSION OF TYMEX.  THE TC PROGRAM LISTS
THE NAMES OF ALL TMPCOR AND DSK:###NAM.TMP FILES, AND THEN LETS YOU
LOOK AT ANY OF THEM BY TYPING THE NAME OF EACH ONE YOU WANT.  A
CARRIAGE RETURN WITH NO NAME BEFORE IT WILL CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO BE
RUN WHICH NORMALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN RUN.  TC MAY ALSO BE LOADED BY
ITSELF TO BE RUN WITHOUT TYMEX.  ONE SPECIAL THING TC DOES IS PRINTING
OF A DOT AFTER DSK:.TMP FILE NAMES WHEN IT PRINTS THE FILE LIST.
WHEN A FILE NAME IS TYPED INTO THE PROGRAM, IT WILL FIRST LOOK FOR
A TMPCOR FILE WITH THAT NAME, AND THEN A DSK:.TMP FILE.  IF THE USER
TYPES THE THREE-CHARACTER NAME AND A DOT, TC WILL LOOK ONLY FOR
THE DISK FILE.
