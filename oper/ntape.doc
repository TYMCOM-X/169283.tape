ALL READING IS 1 CHARACTER/PAPER TAPE FRAME AND WRITTEN ON
THE DISK AS 5 7-BIT CHARACTERS/MACHINE WORD (STANDARD ASCII FORMAT).

*** OPTIONS FOR BINARY READ/PUNCH

        PACK - 8-BIT CHARACTERS ARE READ FROM TELETYPE: ON DISK,
               PACKING IS 8-BIT CHARACTERS ACROSS WORD BOUNDARIES (SIMPL
               IOCS "PACK" FORMAT). PUNCH READS PACK FORMAT FILE AND
               PUNCHES 8-BIT CHARACTERS, 1 PER FRAME
        DATA - 8-BIT CHARACTERS ARE READ FROM TELETYPE: ON DISK,
               PACKING IS ONE 8-BIT CHARACTER PER WORD, RIGHT-
               JUSTIFIED IN THE WORD.  PUNCH READS 1 8-BIT CHR/WORD FILE
               AND PUNCHES 8-BIT CHARACTER, 1 PER FRAME

FOLLOWING READ PAPER TAPE AS 8-BIT CHARACTERS, BITS 1-6 BEING DATA,
BIT 7 IGNORED, AND BIT 8 BEING EITHER PARITY OR IGNORED.  ON DISK,
CHARACTER ARE 6 6-BIT CHARACTER PER WORD, FILLING THE WORD.

        EVEN - PARITY [8TH] BIT MUST BE EVEN
        ODD -  PARITY [8TH] BIT MUST BE ODD
        NONE/OFF - PARITY BIT IGNORED


COMMAND- ECHO
-------------

THE ECHO COMMAND CONTROLS ECHOING OF READING TAPE.  ARGUMENTS ARE:

                        EVERY CARRIAGE RETURN ON DISK, WILL WRITE OUT
                        A CARRIAGE-RETURN.

SPECIAL NOTES:

        (1) MULTIPLE STRINGS MAY BE WRITTEN OR PUNCHED, BUT AS SO FAR
                AS SEARCHES GO, ONLY THE FIRST CHARACTER OF "EXTERNAL"
                ON READING, AND ONLY THE FIRST CHARACTER OF "INTERNAL"
                ON PUNCHING WILL BE LOOKED FOR.
        (2) A "," MAY BE USED AS A SEPARATOR ONLY IF THERE IS ONE
                CHARACTER ON "INTERNAL" AND ONE CHARACTER ON "EXTERNAL"
                (I.E.,  :SUB "A","B"   OR  :SUB CR,LF)

                  CHARACTER (EDITOR CONTROL-A FUNCTION)
        <CHARACTER>::= ANY VALID CHARACTER REPRESENTATION

EXAMPLES:

        :EDI LINE="^" CHARACTER="_"
        :EDI LINE=NOTHING               (TURNS OFF LINE-EDITING CHAR)
        :EDI CH=BACKARROW L=1

COMMAND- SPLICE
---------------

THIS COMMAND ALLOWS A USER TO RECOVER FROM A CRASH DURING PAPER TAPE
READING.  ARGUMENT IS THE JOB ID GIVEN TO YOU BY NTAPE WHEN YOU FIRST
CALLED IT FROM THE EXEC.  EXAMPLE:

        :SPLICE <JOBID>

        READ IN ABOUT 10 INCHES OF TAPE

        (TURN ON READER, READ IN REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TAPE, STOP READER)

IF NTAPE FINDS A MATCH,

        FOUND MATCH.  TURN ON READER

YOU CAN NOW TURN THE READER ON AND PROCEED.

IF NTAPE CANT FIND A MATCH,

        NO MATCH FOUND.  TRY AGAIN? (YES OR NO ANSWER)

"NO" CAUSES RETURN TO COMMAND LEVEL, "YES" REPEATS THE "READ IN ABOUT
10 INCHES OF TAPE" QUESTION.  BEFORE TYPING "YES<CR>" USER SHOULD
REPOSITION TAPE SO IT IS ABOUT 5 FEET BACK.

COMMAND- SAVE
-------------

TAKES FILE NAME AS ARGUMENT AND SAVES CURRENT TRANSLATION TABLE IN
READABLE EDITOR-TYPE CODE ON A FILE.

COMMAND- LOAD
