
TAPE 3.03 SUGGESTIONS

1. THE USE OF THE TERM 'SYMBOLIC' IN THE QUESTION 'SYMBOLIC REPRE-
   SENTATION' IS CONFUSING; THE USER MAY THINK IT REFERS TO
   SYMBOLIC DATA (AS OPPOSED TO BINARY DATA).  I SUGGEST CHANGING
   THE QUESTION TO 'LITERAL REPRESENTATION?'.

2. THE RUN COMMAND SHOULD ASK FOR EDITING DURING PAPER TAPE
   READING. (IT DOESN'T NOW.)

3. THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION TO ALWAYS PUNCH THE 8TH LEVEL DURING
   SYMBOLIC PUNCHING, FOR 940 COMPATIBILITY.  NOW, THIS OPTION
   IS ASKED ONLY WHEN THE USER SPECIFIES A BINARY PUNCH.

4. THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION TO TERMINATE TAPE READING
   WITH A CONTROL CHARACTER AS WELL AS WITH THE 10 SECOND WAIT.

5. THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION TO PUNCH MORE THAN ONE FILE, AS
   IN THE 940 PAPER TAPE PACKAGE, BY FOLLOWING EACH FILE
   NAME TO BE PUNCHED WITH A LINE FEED AND THE LAST FILE NAME
   BY A CARRIAGE RETURN.


TAPE 3.03 BUGS

1. WHEN PUNCHING A SYMBOLIC FILE CONTAINING ONE LINE
   OF LESS THAN 14 CHARACTERS (INCLUDING THE FINAL CR AND LF)
   TAPE PRINTS FROM 1 TO 3 NULL FRAMES BETWEEN THE END OF THE
   DATA AND THE FINAL THREE RUBOUTS.

   EXAMPLE

   FOR THE FILE
  
   123456789<CR>

   TAPE PUNCHES THE CODES FOR
 
   123456789<CR><LF><THREE NULLS><THREE RUBOUTS>

2. THE REPRESENTATION COMMAND DOES NOT HANDLE TERMINATING COMMAS
   PROPERLY.

   EXAMPLE

   FOR THE FILE

   1,12,177<CR>

   THE COMMANDS

   :REPRESENTATION INTERNAL
   :PUNCH <FILE NAME>

   CAUSE ONLY THE 1 TO BE PUNCHED.

3. WHEN USING THE COMMAND 'REPRESENTATION INTERNAL' TO PUNCH
   A TAPE, A 9 ON THE INPUT FILE IS PUNCHED AS A NULL.  THIS
   SHOULD NOT HAPPEN; AN ERROR MESSAGE STATING THAT 9 IS NOT A
   VALID OCTAL CODE SHOULD BE GIVEN.

4. THE SUBSTITUTE COMMAND WORKS BACKWARDS; THAT IS, IT
   TAKES THE FORM 'SUB <EXTERNAL> FOR <INTERNAL>' INSTEAD OF
   'SUB <INTERNAL> FOR <EXTERNAL>'.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FILE

   12345678901234

   THE COMMAND 'SUB 'A' FOR '1' ' CAUSES AN A TO BE PUNCHED FOR
   EACH 1 WHEN PUNCHING, AND 'SUB '1' FOR 'A' ' CAUSES
   NOTHING TO HAPPEN WHEN PUNCHING.  ON THE OTHER HAND, 'SUB
   'B' FOR '2' ' CAUSES NOTHING TO HAPPEN WHEN READING, BUT 'SUB
   '2' FOR 'B' ' CAUSES A B TO BE SUBSTITUTED FOR EACH 2 WHEN
    READING.
