                             PREFACE





          This PROFILE manual is  divided  into  three  sections.
     The  first  is  an  introductory  example of typical PROFILE
     usage,  beginning  with  simple  report   generation   using
     standard  ("deterministic") data and progressing to usage of
     simulation ("probabilistic") data for risk analysis.

          The second  section  is  a  reference  manual  for  the
     frequent  user.  It summarizes all the commands available in
     the PROFILE system and explains their meaning.

          The third section  is  intended  to  help  the  analyst
     evaluate  how  PROFILE  could meet his needs.  It contains a
     discussion of the overall capacities  of  PROFILE,  hardware
     and  software required, and the pertinent assumptions behind
     the output reports.


          As authors of PROFILE, we  are  grateful  to  the  many
     people  whose  suggestions  and  ideas  proved  so valuable.
     Further suggestions for improvements are welcomed.

                 CONVENTIONS USED IN THIS MANUAL





          Throughout this manual the  following  conventions  are
     observed when explaining the form of a command or input:



     N1 = numeric argument


     () = an optional field


        = carriage return


        = required characters or user input



          The underlining convention is used to show the required
     characters of a command whenever explaining the general form
     of the command.  If examples are shown, all typing  done  by
     the user is underlined to distinguish it from messages typed
     by the PROFILE system.

                           SECTION I:





                  PROFILE FOR REPORT GENERATION





          The PROFILE forecasting system  serves  as  an  aid  to
     business,  government, and educational planners.  Most often
     PROFILE  is  used  to  forecast  the  financial  effects  of
     alternative  management  decisions.   Yet  PROFILE  can also
     quickly tabulate  and  display  nicely  formated  management
     reports consisting of historic information.

          The PROFILE system is conceptually easy  to  understand
     yet  highly  flexible.  The user writes a series of "rules",
     relating quantitative data  inputs  to  the  desired  output
     forms:



















                                                    PAGE   4



          Three separate programs assist  the  decision-maker  in
     this process as shown below:

     the experienced user using a standard system editor.

          A file ABC.REP with the  user's  report  specifications
     has now been created and saved.  (The experienced user could
     create this same file using the system editor.)

     DATA FILE NAME? ABC.DAT

       
     -


          A file ABC.DAT with the user's input data has now  been
     created and saved.




     3.   The third step is to create the  "rules"  which  relate
     the report lines to the input data.  PROFILE is run with the
     "rules" to produce the user's reports.

          The rules file consists of two required routines called
     SETUP   and   RULES.    Both  are  actually  simple  Fortran
     subroutines,  as  shown  below  for  the  ABC   CORPORATION.
     Example:

                                                    PAGE   8

                                                   lines always
                                                   required
     SUBROUTINE SETUP
     COMMON /PROZZZ/ ISEED,NTRIAL,ITRIAL,NPER,IPER,PVRATE,FVRATE,
  +  R(100),D(500),KILRUN,KILTRI,KILPER,IOUNIT,DFILE(2),RFILE(2)

     R(1) = D(1)                                   supplied by user

     RETURN                                        last two lines
     END                                           always required



     SUBROUTINE RULES
     COMMON /PROZZZ/ ISEED,NTRIAL,ITRIAL,NPER,IPER,PVRATE,FVRATE,
  +  R(100),D(500),KILRUN,KILTRI,KILPER,IOUNIT,DFILE(2),RFILE(2)
     R(1) = R(1) * (1.0 + D(2))
     R(2) = D(3)
     R(3) = R(1) * D(3)
     R(4) = R(3) * D(4)
     R(5) = R(3) * D(5)
     R(6) = D(6)
     R(7) = D(7)
     R(8) = R(3)-R(4)-R(5)-R(6)-R(7)             supplied by user
     R(9) = R(8) * D(8)
     R(10) = R(8) - R(9)
     R(11) = R(10) + R(7)
     R(12) = D(9)
     R(13) = R(11) + R(12)
     RETURN
     END


     NOTE: Since the RULES consist of fortran subroutines,  these
     should  conform  to  the  usual  requirements of the fortran
     language:

      1.  Each statement consists of  three  parts:  a  statement
          label, a continuation mark, and the statement itself.

      2.  The statement label is an optional number between 1 and
          99999  appearing in columns 1-5 of any statement.  This
          statement  number  identifies  statements   which   are
          referenced by other statements.

      3.  To extend a statement from one  line  to  the  next,  a
          character  (other  than  a  blank  or  zero)  should be
          entered in column six.

      4.  The statement itself  can  be  any  allowable  standard
          fortran statement.  (See the fortran reference manual.)
          The statement is entered in columns 7-72.

          PAGE   9



      5.  Any line can be designated as a comment line  (inserted
          to  document,  format,  etc.) by entering the character
          "c" in column 1.  Comment lines are ignored by fortran,
          except that they are printed when the file is listed.


          Whereas  the  PROFILE  report  specification  file   is
     entered  either  through  PROREP or a system editor, and the
     data file is entered  either  through  PRODEP  or  a  system
     editor,  the  RULES file is always constructed in a standard
     system editor, for example TECO or EDITOR.   (These  editors
     are explained in their respective reference manuals.)

          The user-supplied statements are most easily created by
     proceeding  through  each defined output row - the first row
     is referred to as R(1), the second as R(2), etc.  - and then
     determining  how  to  calculate  it from other rows or input
     data - the first data element is referred to  as  D(1),  the
     second as D(2), etc.

          For example, in SUBROUTINE RULES, the TOTAL MARKET (ROW
     1)  in  any  one  year  is  the previous year's TOTAL MARKET
     multiplied by 1 plus a percentage GROWTH RATE (D(2)  is  the
     MARKET GROWTH RATE).  Thus the rule R(1)=R(1)*(1.0+D(2)).

          Calculating the second row is even easier.  Row 2  (ABC
     SHARE)  was given in the input data - D(3) VECTOR ABC SHARE.
     Thus R(2)=D(3).

          Row 3 (ABC GROSS SALES) is simply the product of  TOTAL
     MARKET (ROW 1) times ABC SHARE (D(3)).  Thus R(3)=R(1)*D(3).

          In this way each of the 13 rows  in  this  example  are
     easily  calculated  and  their  equations  or rules put into
     SUBROUTINE RULES.  This routine will be  executed  over  and
     over  again - once for each column or forecast period in the
     analysis (10 periods in this example).

          Sometimes  a  few  values  must   be   initialized   or
     established  prior to calculating any of the output columns.
     These statements go  into  SUBROUTINE  SETUP.   In  the  ABC
     CORPORATION example, the TOTAL MARKET is the previous year's
     TOTAL MARKET times a  growth  factor.   Since  the  analysis
     starts  with  1972,  the  TOTAL  MARKET  FOR  1971  must  be
     established before the period  by  period  analysis  begins.
     The  "1971  market"  is  given by input data number 1 - thus
     R(1)=D(1) establishes the initial market.

          In some cases, the logic of  the  problem  requires  no
     initializing;   thus   no  arithmetic  statements  would  be
     required in SUBROUTINE SETUP and it would  consist  only  of
     the three statements:

           SUBROUTINE SETUP
           RETURN
           END 


          SETUP and RULES can be written together  in  one  file,
     called,  in  this  example,  MYRULES  (an  extension  .F4 is
     optional).  To produce a report, the user should run PROFILE

                    PROFILE FOR RISK ANALYSIS




          Extending  any  PROFILE  "deterministic"  analysis   to
     incorporate risk analysis techniques has been designed to be
     a simple, straight-forward process.  In this way, a user can
     begin  with  the  familiar  "best  guess" approach and later
     advance to probabilistic risk analysis forecasts.

          The following three steps, analogous to  the  steps  in
     the  original  example,  will  convert  the original PROFILE
     forecast to a risk analysis forecast.  

     1.   Use PROREP to specify one or more of the risk  analysis
     reports as follows:



     -R (CC)PROREP

     PROREP

     NEW OR OLD? OLD                           user retrieves

     2.   Use  PRODEP   to   change   appropriate   data   from

          The PROREP program permits simple, interactive creation
     and  editing  of  report  specifications  used  in a PROFILE
     forecast.  PROREP permits the user to  either  retrieve  old
     specifications  or  create  new  ones in order to set up the
     "current" specifications within PROREP.  Changes, additions,
     and  deletions  affect  current  specifications.   No  saved
     report specification files are altered until the user  saves
     the  current  data.   A  series  of  simple,  yet  powerful,
     commands allow the user to control the  interactive  editing
     process:

          PAGE  17
          PROREP


          There are four types of  report  specifications  to  be
     supplied  -  titles,  column headings, row names, and output
     report types.  The specifications are entered in response to

         TITLE 1: ABC CORPORATION
         TITLE 2:

     and the sequence of each of the four sections is  terminated
     by a carriage return.  (Typing errors can be corrected prior
     to a carriage return by typing an "erase instruction" or can
     be  corrected  after  a  carriage  return using PROREP's "^"
     command.  See "PROFILE Input and Editing Aids".)

          The specifications are saved on a file, separated  from
     one another by the keywords:

          Up to 3 lines, 80 characters each.  No  title  need  be
     specified.   One  or  more  blank title lines (followed by a
     non-blank title line) will be interpreted as blank titles.


     2.  *COLUMNS

          Up to 52 columns, 10 characters each.   The  number  of
     column headings supplied determines the number of columns or
     "periods"  in  the  analysis.   Blank  column  headings  are
     permitted  in  all  but  the  last column.  There must be at
     least one column defined.

          The column heading can be followed by  any  of  several
     options,  enclosed  in  angle  brackets  <>.  Column options
     override row options if both are  in  effect  for  the  same
     output field.  Column options include:

      DECIMALS = N to specify the number of decimal places to  be
               shown.   "N" can range from 0-8.  If no DEC = N is
               supplied, 2 decimal places are  shown.   A  number
               too  large  to  be  shown will be output as "***".
               (DEC = -1 will show up to  5  significant  digits.
               Numbers  to  large  to  fit into the output report
               will be shown in "E" format instead of "***".)

          NULL to null out each number in a column if  its  value
               is zero.

             $ to precede each value in the column with a  dollar
               sign.

             % to follow each value in the column with a  percent
               sign.

             ( to specify that any negative values in the  column
               should be displayed enclosed in parentheses rather
               than with a leading minus sign.

         COMMA to specify  that  commas  should  be  included  in
               output quantites to designate thousands, millions,
               etc.

          The six options may appear in any  logical  combination
     and  in  any  sequence, separated by commas or blanks.  They
     are specified anywhere  on  the  same  line  as  the  column

          PAGE  19
          PROREP


     heading,  except  that  the  column heading must precede the
     options.


     3.  *ROWS

          Up to 100 rows, 15 characters each.  Blank row headings
     are  permitted  in  all  but the last row.  There must be at
     least one row defined.

          The row heading can  be  followed  by  any  of  several
     options,  enclosed  in angle brackets <>.  These row options
     are always overridden by  column  options  if  both  are  in
     effect for the same output field.  Row options include:

      DECIMALS = N to specify the number of decimal places to  be
               shown.   "N" can range from 0-8.  If no DEC = N is
               supplied, 2 decimal places are  shown.   A  number
               too  large  to  be  shown will be output as "***".
               (DEC = -1 will show up to  5  significant  digits.
               Numbers  too  large  to fit into the output report
               will be shown in "E" format instead of "***".)

          SKIP = N to specify that  N  lines  should  be  skipped
               after  the  row  has  been printed.  "N" cannot be
               greater than 99.

         ULINE (= N) to underline the row values after  they  are
               printed.   ULINE=1  results in single underlining,
               whereas ULINE=2  results  in  double  underlining.
               (If  =N  is  omitted,  =1  is  assumed.)  If  both
               SKIP = N and ULINE = N are specified,  underlining
               takes place first.

          NULL to null out each number in a row if its  value  is
               zero.

             $ to precede each value in the  row  with  a  dollar
               sign.

             % to follow each value in the  row  with  a  percent
               sign.

             ( to specify that any negative  values  in  the  row
               should be displayed enclosed in parentheses rather
               than with a leading minus sign.

         COMMA to indicate that commas should be included in  the
               output    quantities   to   designate   thousands,
               millions, etc.

          The eight options may appear in any logical combination
     and  in  any  sequence, separated by commas or blanks.  They

     are specified anywhere on the same line as the row  heading,
     except that the row heading must precede the options.


     4.  *OUTPUT

          The user can specify any of  the  five  allowed  output
     reports:


     (1) STANDARD (<options>)

          The STANDARD report defines  the  standard  "table"  or
     matrix  form output report.  Several options can be enclosed
     in angle brackets:

         WIDTH = N to specify  how  many  columns  should  appear
               across  the page.  If no "WIDTH = N" is specified,
               5 columns are assumed.  The maximum n is  10.   (A
               72  character teletype will permit 5 columns, i.e.
               a 15 character row  name  and  five  11  character
               columns.)

          ROWS = N1  (N2  N3-N4  ...   D(NO)  D(NO)-D(NO)...)  to
               specify  which rows are to be printed, and in what
               sequence.  Row numbers can be listed individually,
               separated   by   blanks   or  commas,  or  can  be
               hyphenated to  indicate  a  series,  i.e.   "1-10"
               means ROW 1 through ROW 10.

               A pair of hyphenated numbers can be  in  ascending
               or  descending  sequence.   The  entire  series of
               individual or hyphenated numbers  can  be  in  any
               sequence  to  specify  the  order  of  output, for
               example <ROWS = 10 - 1> or <ROWS = 100,  1-10,  1,
               100>   is  legal.   If  no  ROWS  =  N  option  is
               specified,  all  defined  rows  are   printed   in
               ascending  row number sequence.  If ROWS= D(NO) is
               specified, the row numbers to be printed are taken
               from  the indicated data variables after a profile
               model is run.  Thus the user's model  can  control
               output.

       COLUMNS = N1 (N2 N3-N4 ...  D(NO) D(NO)-D(NO) ...) Same as
               ROWS =.

          DATE to  specify  that  the  current  date  (DD-MMM-YY)
               should  be shown once left justified at the top of
               the standard report, or at the top of each page of
               the  standard report if either the PAGE or HEADING
               options are in effect.

          PAGE  21
          PROREP


          PAGE to specify that  the  standard  report  should  be
               broken  into  pages  with  the  page  number right
               justified at the top of each page,  and  the  date
               left justified if the date option is in effect.

       HEADING is the same as the PAGE option except  that  after
               printing  the  page number (and date if specified)
               at the top of  each  page,  any  specified  titles
               (including  run  I.D.)  and  column  headings  are
               repeated.  (60 printed lines per page for PAGE  or
               HEADING options.)


     (2) PV AT N% ROW1 (=CONTINUOUS) (ROW2 (=CONTINUOUS))...(<options>)
                       (=DISCRETE)         (=DISCRETE)
                       (=BDISCRETE)        (=BDISCRETE)

          The present value  report  specification  includes  the
     discount  rate  (n%  must  be  greater  than  0%),  and  the
     specification of which row or rows (up to  five)  should  be
     discounted.   The  optional  "=CONTINUOUS",  "=DISCRETE", or
     "=BDISCRETE"  extension  to  a  row  specifies  whether  the
     discounting  process  is  done  continuously  over  the time
     period, discretely  at  the  end  of  the  time  period,  or
     discretely  at  the  beginning  of  the time period.  (If no
     "=CONTINUOUS",  "=DISCRETE",  or  "=BDISCRETE"   is   given,
     discrete discounting is assumed.)

          Permissible PV options are:

         GRAPH (=CUMULATIVE)(=MASS)to specify that  a  cumulative
               or  mass  probability  graph  should be printed in
               addition to the report.  If neither  "=CUMULATIVE"
               or "=MASS" is specified, cumulative is assumed.

     INTERVALS = N to specify the number of probability intervals
               to be shown on a risk profile report.  "N" must be
               between  0  and  99.   If  none  is  specified,  4
               (quartiles) is assumed.

          TIME = N or TIME = D(NO) to specify the number of years
               represented  by  one  output column or "period" in
               the forecast.  "N" is the number  of  years.   For
               example,  if one period represents 6 months, "TIME
               = .5" is specified.  If no "TIME =  n"  is  given,
               "TIME  =  1"  (one  year  periods) is assumed.  If
               D(NO) is specified, the time period is taken  from
               the indicated D(NO) after a PROFILE model is run.


     (3) FV AT N% ROW1 (=CONTINUOUS) (ROW2 (=CONTINUOUS))...(<options>)
                       (=DISCRETE)         (=DISCRETE)

          The future value report specification includes the rate
     at which cash flows are to be compounded (n% must be greater
     than 0%), and the specification of which row or rows (up  to
     five)  should  be  compounded.   The optional "=CONTINUOUS",
     "=DISCRETE", or "=BDISCRETE" extension to  a  row  specifies
     whether  the  compounding  process is done continuously over
     the time period, discretely at the end of the  time  period,
     or  discretely  at the beginning of the time period.  (If no
     "=CONTINUOUS",  "=DISCRETE",  or  "=BDISCRETE"   is   given,
     discrete compounding is assumed.)

          Permissible FV options are:

         GRAPH (=CUMULATIVE)(=MASS)to specify that  a  cumulative
               or  mass  probability  graph  should be printed in
               addition to the report.  If neither  "=CUMULATIVE"
               or "=MASS" is specified, cumulative is assumed.

     INTERVALS = N to specify the number of probability intervals
               to be shown on a risk profile report.  "N" must be
               between  0  and  99.   If  none  is  specified,  4
               (quartiles) is assumed.

          TIME = N or TIME = D(NO) to specify the number of years
               represented  by  one  output column or "period" in
               the forecast.  "N" is the number  of  years.   For
               example,  if one period represents 6 months, "TIME
               = .5" is specified.  If no "TIME =  n"  is  given,
               "TIME  =  1"  (one  year  periods) is assumed.  If
               D(NO) is specified, the time period is taken  from
               the  indicated data variable after a PROFILE model
               is run.


     (4) ROI ROW1 (=CONTINUOUS) (ROW2 (=CONTINUOUS))...(<options>)
                  (=DISCRETE)         (=DISCRETE)
                  (=BDISCRETE)        (=BDISCRETE)

          The ROI report specification includes the row  or  rows
     for  which  the  breakeven internal rate of return should be
     calculated.  (This will be calculated within the  limits  of
     0%  and  1000%.) The optional "=CONTINUOUS", "=DISCRETE", or
     "=BDISCRETE"  extension  to  a  row  specifies  whether  the
     discounting  process  is  done  continuously  over  the time
     period, discretely  at  the  end  of  the  time  period,  or
     discretely  at  the  beginning  of  the time period.  (If no
     "=CONTINUOUS",  "=DISCRETE",  or  "=BDISCRETE"   is   given,
     discrete discounting is assumed.)

          Permissible ROI options are:

         GRAPH (=CUMULATIVE)(=MASS)to specify that  a  cumulative
               or  mass  probability  graph  should be printed in

          PAGE  23

               addition to the report.  If neither  "=CUMULATIVE"
               or "=MASS" is specified, cumulative is assumed.

     INTERVALS = N to specify the number of probability intervals
               to be shown on a risk profile report.  "N" must be
               between  0  and  99.   If  none  is  specified,  4

          TIME = N or TIME = D(NO) to specify the number of years
               represented  by  one  output column or "period" in
               the forecast.  "N" is the number  of  years.   For
               example,  if one period represents 6 months, "TIME
               = .5" is specified.  If no "TIME =  n"  is  given,
               "TIME  =  1"  (one  year  periods) is assumed.  If
               D(NO) is specified, the time period is taken  from
               the  indicated data variable after a PROFILE model
               is run.


     (5) RISK N ROW N COL N (<options>)

          The   RISK   PROFILE   specification    includes    the
     specification of the RISK PROFILE number, i.e.  RISK 1, RISK
     2, etc.  (Up to 6 risk profiles can be specified.), and  the
     row  and  column  numbers  which  designate  the item on the
     standard report for which the risk profile is desired.  

          Permissible RISK options are:

     INTERVALS = N to specify the number of probability intervals
               to be shown on a risk profile report.  "N" must be

      Description: The   LIST   command   lists    the    current
                   specifications.  Giving no arguments will list
                   everything.  Specifying a  keyword  will  list
                   everything  in  that  section.  Specifying one
                   numeric argument  will  list  that  one  line,
                   while  a  second argument will provide a range
                   of lines.

          PROREP


                       PROREP FILE LAYOUT





          The file produced by PROREP is free format and  can  be
     created  by  the  experienced user through a standard system
     editor.  The file can contain line numbers.   However,  line
     numbers  will  not be saved if the file is edited or created
     via PROREP.  The following rules  should  be  followed  when
     editing a PROREP file outside PROREP.


             - The file must start each section with one  of  the
               keywords 
                         *TITLE 
                         *COLUMNS 
                         *ROWS 
                         *OUTPUT

               While the sections can be in any  order  (and  any
               one  section  need  not  be  contiguous), the very
               first line of the file must be a keyword.

             - Any   blank   lines   will   be   interpreted   as
               significant, i.e., as a blank column heading, etc.

             - Standard system protection codes can  be  used  to
               protect files as necessary.

             - Any input line can be continued onto another  line
               by including an "&" at the end of the line.

             - If line numbers exist, the first  character  after
               the line number will be ignored.

          Each report specification is on  the  file  as  entered
     through PROREP (although some respacing may occur to improve
     readability).   Thus,  the  PROREP  program  can  serve   to
     introduce  this  specification  structure  to  the new user.
     When the user becomes familiar with the file layout, he  may
     choose to create and edit his report files outside PROREP.

          A sample report specification file follows:

          PRODEP


                         PRODEP OVERVIEW





          The PRODEP program  permits  a  user  to  interactively
     create and edit a data file to be used as input to a PROFILE
     forecast.  When the user runs PRODEP he can either  retrieve
     "old" data or he can enter "new" data in order to set up the
     "current"  data  within  PRODEP.   Changes,  additions,  and
     deletions  affect  this current data but in no way alter any
     saved data until the user specifies that  the  current  data
     should  be saved.  A series of simple, yet powerful commands
     allow a user to control the interactive editing process:































          When defining data within PRODEP the user is  asked  to
     supply the following information:

                                                    PAGE  42
                                                    PRODEP


     D(NO) TYPE NAME:


          Number of         Type of*         An optional
          the data          the data         name for the
          variable          variable         data variable
          to be             to be            to be
          defined.          defined.         defined.



          The  data  variable  numbers  can  be  entered  in  any
     sequence,  permitting easy corrections of previously entered
     data.  The data variable  type  should  be  one  of  several
     allowed  PRODEP types explained in detail under "PRODEP Data
     Input  Types".   Some  of  the   data   types   are   simple
     deterministic  inputs  for  quick  report generation.  Other
     data types are more  complicated  probabilistic  inputs  for
     risk  analysis.   The  user  need  only become familiar with
     those types which  apply  to  his  area  of  analysis.   The
     optional  data  variable  name  is used to identify the data
     variable on listings and saved data files.  

          When  the  user  supplies  the  requested  information,
     PRODEP  will ask the required values depending upon the data
     type.  A carriage return response to "D(NO) TYPE NAME:" will
     end the defining process.








   * The data variable type and name need  only  be  entered  the
     first  time a variable is defined.  Once a variable has been
     defined, the type and name are  both  optional  for  further
     redefinition by the user:

            1. If no type is given, the current type and name are
               assumed.

            2. If a type is given, but  no  name,  the  new  type
               replaces  the  old  type,  and the current name is
               assumed.

            3. If both a type and name are given,  both  the  new
               type  and  name  will replace the current type and

      Description: A series of values which will join  two  other
                   data  variables,  one  representing  the  data
                   value  in  any  "beginning"  period   of   the
                   forecast   time   horizon,   and   the  second
                   representing the data value  in  any  "ending"
                   period of the forecast time horizon.


          Example: D(NO) TYPE NAME: 3 TREND ABC SHARE
                   D(BEG) D(END) NO. PAIRS: 10 COL=D(2) 11 COL=10 2
                   PERIOD & VALUE: 4 .30
                   PERIOD & VALUE: 6 .35

                   D(NO) TYPE NAME: 


            Notes: The beginning data  variable  and  the  ending
                   data  variable  can  be  any  other  constant,
                   discrete, continuous, or normal data variables
                   which have been entered or will be entered.

                   The beginning D(NO) is assumed  to  correspond
                   to   column  (period)  1  unless  an  optional
                   COLUMN= field immediately follows, designating
                   the  initial  column.   COLUMN=  can  also  be
                   specified   for   the   ending   D(NO).     If
                   probabilistic,  the beginning and ending D(NO)
                   are sampled with the same random  number,  and
                   are therefore dependent.

                   COLUMN=N specifies  the  beginning  or  ending
                   column    number    directly.     COLUMN=D(NO)
                   specifies that the beginning or ending  column
                   number is given by the indicated data variable
                   when a PROFILE run is made.  Thus, the  timing
                   of  a  trend  can be made dependent upon other
                   data variables, or set by the user's model.

                   If no "PERIOD & VALUE" pairs  are  input,  the
                   trend variable takes on values for each period
                   in the time  horizon  along  a  straight  line
                   between   the   beginning   and   ending  data
                   variables.    If   intermediate   pairs    are
                   specified,  the  values are shifted toward the
                   intermediate points.

                   TREND (continued)


            Notes: Periods which precede the beginning  D(NO)  or
                   follow  the  ending  D(NO)  are assigned trend
                   values of zero, or the value of any  midpoints
                   specified   for  the  periods.   Thus  periods
                   outside the "beginning-ending" trend range can
                   be  made deterministic by specifying midpoints
                   for the periods.

                   Intermediate periods must be entered with each
                   succeeding  period  greater than the preceding
                   period.

             Form: N1 MULTIVARIATE (DATA TITLE) (*) 


      Description: A  deterministic  or  probabilistic   variable
                   which  can  be  made  dependent  upon  another
                   independent data variable.


          Example: D(NO) TYPE NAME: 3 MULTIVARIATE ABC SHARE *
                   IND VAR D(NO): 6

                   D(NO) TYPE NAME: 


            Notes: The independent data variable can be any other
                   non-multivariate  data variable which has been
                   entered or will be entered.

                   The  value  assigned   to   the   multivariate
                   variable  is related to the dependent variable
                   as follows: VALUE = A + B*(IND VAR) + E.   "A"
                   is   a   constant   term  which  can  be  made
                   probabilistic  by  entering   "VAR   A",   the
                   variance  of A.  "B" is a coefficient relating
                   the independent  variable,  to  the  dependent
                   variable  and  it can be made probabilistic by
                   entering "VAR B", the variance of B.   "E"  is
                   the variance of an error term which has a mean
                   of zero.  "COVAR" is  the  covariance  between
                   the  constant  term A and the coefficient term
                   B.

                   The  optional  "*"  controls  the  timing   of
                   selection  of new values from the multivariate
                   inputs.  If no * appears, a  single  value  is
                   chosen  at  the  start  of a forecast, and the
                   value is held over all  time  periods  in  the
                   time  horizon.   If  the  * is included, a new
                   value is chosen for each time  period  in  the
                   time horizon.

                       PRODEP FILE LAYOUT





          The file produced by PRODEP is free format and  can  be
     created  by  the  experienced user through a standard system
     editor if he chooses.  The file can  contain  line  numbers.
     However,  line  numbers  will  not  be  saved if the file is
     edited or created via PRODEP.  The following rules should be
     followed when editing a PRODEP file outside PRODEP:


             - The file must start  with  "*DATA"  as  the  first
               line.

             - Data variables  can  be  entered  in  any  numeric
               order.   If  duplicates  exist,  the last variable
               with the duplicate number will take precedence.

             - No  blank  lines  should   appear   between   data
               variables on the file, or at the end of the file.

             - Standard system protection codes can  be  utilized
               to protect files as a user sees fit.

             - Any input line can be continued onto another  line
               by including an "&" at the end of the line.  

             - If line numbers exist, the first  character  after
               the line number will be ignored.  


          Each data  variable  on  the  file  should  be  entered
     according  to one of the following forms which are explained
     in detail under "PRODEP Data Input Types":

     PRODEP,  or  when  a  data file is "listed" via PRODEP.  The
     PRODEP program can serve to introduce this data structure to
     the  new user.  When the user becomes familiar with the data
     layout, he may choose to create  and  edit  his  data  files
     outside the PRODEP program.

                        PROFILE OVERVIEW





          The PROFILE program accepts the  PRODEP  data  and  the
     PROREP   report   specifications,  and  produces  management
     reports or risk analysis reports according to a set of rules
     provided  by the user.  The PROFILE program can also be used
     to edit the PRODEP data file which it has retrieved.   After
     retrieving  both a data file and a report file, the user can
     control the analysis with  a  set  of  simple  yet  powerful
     commands:
























     *

   * A run identification can be specified, and  will  appear  as
     the  last line of the title to distinguish different sets of
     data using the same report file.

     If the RULES file is specified without an extension and  can
     not  be found, an .F4 extension is assumed, provided that an
     .F4 file  with  the  same  name  exists.   RULES  files  are
     recompiled  only if changes have been made to the file since
     the last compilation.  Compilation and loading can  both  be
     by-passed  by saving the PROFILE model (via the PROFILE DUMP
     command).  When PROFILE then requests  "RULES  FILE  NAME?",
     the saved model should be specified with a .SAV extension to
     indicate that the model can be run directly by PROFILE.

                   APPEND


             Form: APPEND


      Description: The APPEND command merges an existing  PROFILE
                   data file with the current data in PROFILE.


          Example: NEXT? APPEND

                   DATA FILE NAME? ABC2.DAT

                   NEXT? 


            Notes: If duplicate data variable numbers exist,  the
                   current  variable  will  be  deleted  and  the
                   variable from the file will be  included.   If
                   the  duplicate  variable  on  the file lacks a
                   name (or both a type and a name)  the  current
                   name (or type and name) are assumed.

                   If no file name is supplied, or the file  name
                   is in error, the operation is by-passed.

                   BINARY


             Form: BINARY


      Description: The BINARY command makes use  of  the  PROFILE
                   "store"  capability.   After a model's reports
                   have been run  and  stored  with  the  "store"
                   switch  on,  the binary command will write the
                   stored reports to  a  special  PROFILE  binary
                   file.   Binary  files saved in this manner can
                   be  retrieved  by  PROFILE  models  using  the
                   PROFILE   library   routine   "GETBIN".   (See
                   PROFILE Library Routines, at the end  of  this
                   section.)


          Example: NEXT? BINARY

                   BINARY FILE NAME? ABC.BIN

                   NEXT? 


            Notes: If no file name is supplied, or the file  name
                   is in error, the operation is by-passed.

                   Risk profiles, present  value,  future  value,
                   and  roi  reports  which  were  not stored, or
                   which contain more trials than stored, can not
                   be  correctly  saved  via  the  binary command
                   unless a run is made  to  store  the  specific
                   reports to be saved.

                   Binary is an illegal command if dynamic report
                   memory  has  not been stored, if the number of
                   trials is reset after a report is  stored,  or
                   if  the  number  of  standard  report  rows or
                   columns is altered  via  retrieval  of  a  new
                   report specifications file.

                   The binary command saves unsorted risk profile
                   trial  results  so  that  later aggregation of
                   risk  profiles  (via  SUBROUTINE  GETBIN)  can
                   correctly combine profiles.

                   COPIES


             Form: COPIES


      Description: The COPIES command allows the user to  specify
                   multiple copies of an output report.


          Example: NEXT? COPIES

                   COPIES = 5

                   NEXT? 


            Notes: The COPIES command can be used when output  is
                   routed to a disk file (via the ROUTE command).
                   Many  copies  of  management  reports  can  be
                   rapidly produced utilizing this feature.

             Form: DEFINE


      Description: The  DEFINE  command  initiates  requests  for
                   additional  data  definitions  to  be included
                   with current data.


          Example: NEXT? DEFINE

                   D(NO) TYPE NAME: 


            Notes: Requests   for   data   definitions   can   be
                   terminated  with a carriage return response to
                   "D(NO) TYPE NAME".


                   Data variables can be defined or redefined  in
                   any order.

                   When a data variable is  redefined,  both  the
                   type and name are optional.

                   DELETE


             Form: DELETE N1 (N2)


      Description: The DELETE  command  deletes  current  PROFILE
                   data.    If  the  command  includes  a  single
                   numeric  argument,  one   data   variable   is
                   deleted.    If   two   numeric  arguments  are
                   included, all data variables between  the  two
                   arguments are deleted.


          Example: NEXT? DELETE 1 5

                   NEXT?

                   DUMP


             Form: DUMP


      Description: The DUMP command allows the user to  create  a
                   .SAV file of his PROFILE model, which can then
                   be  run  directly  from  "RULES  FILE   NAME?"
                   without recompilation or loading.


          Example: NEXT? DUMP

                   FILE NAME? ABC

                   NEXT? 


            Notes: The file which is created always is  given  an
                   extension  ".SAV"  by  PROFILE,  and  must  be
                   referenced with this extension when run.

                   If no file name is given, or the file name  is
                   in error, the operation is by-passed.

                   The  user's  entire  core   area   is   saved,
                   including the current data and report files in
                   memory.  Therefore, when a saved model is run,
                   a  carriage  return  response  to either "DATA
                   FILE NAME?" or "REPORT FILE  NAME?"  maintains
                   the  data  or  report file which was in memory
                   when the  model  was  saved.   Similarly,  the
                   number  of trials, copies, random number seed,
                   etc., will be the same as when saved.

                   If a route file is open when a model is saved,
                   it is closed prior to saving.

                   included, all data variables are  listed.   If
                   the   command   includes   a   single  numeric
                   argument, one data variable is listed.  If two
                   numeric   arguments  are  included,  all  data
                   variables  between  the  two   arguments   are
                   listed.

                   data   to   the   console  along  with  titles
                   describing the data.  If no numeric  arguments
                   are  included,  all data variables are listed.
                   If  the  command  includes  a  single  numeric
                   argument, one data variable is listed.  If two
                   numeric  arguments  are  included,  all   data
                   variables   between   the  two  arguments  are
                   listed.


          Example: NEXT? LISTFULL 1

                   PRINT


             Form: PRINT


      Description: This command makes use of the PROFILE  "store"
                   capability.  after a model's reports have been
                   run and stored with the "store" switch on, the
                   PRINT  command  will by-pass running and print
                   output reports to  either  the  console  or  a
                   route  file.   PRINT  will  output  the stored
                   reports  according  to  the   current   report
                   specifications.   Therefore,  the store switch
                   can be set on, a  run  made  of  a  series  of
                   reports, another report file retrieved via the
                   RESTART command, and then  printed  without  a
                   rerun.


          Example: NEXT? PRINT


                                  ABC CORPORATION

            Notes: Risk profiles, present  value,  future  value,
                   and roi reports which were not stored or which
                   contain more trials than stored,  can  not  be
                   printed  correctly  unless  a  run  is made to
                   store the specific reports to be printed.

                   Print is an illegal command if dynamic  report
                   memory  has  not been stored, if the number of
                   trials is reset after a report is  stored,  or

                   The  random   number   generator   is   always
                   initialized  with  the  current  seed prior to
                   each run.

                   If no random number is given  in  response  to
                   "SEED =",  the  current random number starting
                   point is maintained.

                   The  PROFILE  system  is  initialized  with  a
                   random number starting point = 999.

      Description: The  RESTART  command  permits  the  user   to
                   retrieve  different  sets  of  data  or report
                   specifications.

            Notes: When restarting, a carriage return response to
                   the  request for either file name will by-pass
                   reading a new file,  and  retain  the  current
                   file.

                   A report file must contain at  least  one  row
                   heading  and one column heading in order to be
                   retrieved.

                   ROUTE


             Form: ROUTE


      Description: The ROUTE command opens a disk file  to  which
                   all subsequent reports will be printed.


          Example: NEXT? ROUTE

                   TO? ABC.OUT

                   NEXT? 


            Notes: To route printing back to the console, respond
                   "TTY" to the question "TO?".

                   When a new route  file  is  specified  or  the
                   routing   is  returned  to  the  console,  the
                   current route file is closed.  The route  file
                   is  also  closed  if a DUMP command is used to
                   save the current PROFILE  model.   Whenever  a
                   route  file  is  opened,  it  is opened at the
                   start.  Thus a  file  which  was  opened  then
                   closed and reopened will only contain printing
                   done after the second opening.

                   If a route file is open when a BYE command  is
                   given,  or when the user directly runs PRODEP,
                   PROREP, or reruns  PROFILE  (via  the  PRODEP,
                   PROREP,  and  PROFILE commands) the route file
                   is closed automatically prior  to  terminating
                   execution.    If   the   PROFILE   program  is
                   terminated by  means  other  than  these,  all
                   modifications   to  route  files  since  their
                   opening will not be saved.  

                   If no file name is given in response to "TO?",
                   the  current  routing  is  maintained.  If the
                   file name is in error, routing is returned  to
                   the console.

                   numeric argument, a single  data  variable  is
                   saved.  If two numeric arguments are included,
                   all data variables between the first  and  the
                   last are saved.

      Description: The STORE command instructs PROFILE to  retain
                   all dynamic memory allocated to output reports
                   subsequent   to    following    runs.     This
                   facilitates  printing  the  reports  (via  the
                   PRINT command) or  saving  the  reports  on  a
                   binary  file  (via the BINARY command) without
                   rerunning the user's model.

      Description: The TEMPORARY  command  instructs  PROFILE  to
                   enter  temporary  data  change mode.  When the
                   command is given, PROFILE asks "ON OR OFF?" so
                   that  temporary data change mode can be turned
                   on or off.  When temporary data change mode is
                   turned on, all current data (or data indicated
                   by one or two optional data  number  arguments
                   following  "ON")  is  saved  on  a file in the
                   user's area.   The  file  is  given  the  name
                   nnnPR3.TMP,  where  "nnn"  is  the current job
                   number.   After   each   subsequent   run   in
                   temporary data change mode, this saved file is
                   automatically appended (i.e.  merged) into the
                   current  data.   In  this  way, changes can be
                   made to the current data, a run made, and  all
                   temporary  mode  data  will  be  automatically
                   restored to the base case.


          Example: NEXT? TEMPORARY


                   ON OR OFF? ON 10 20


                   NEXT? 


            Notes: Temporary data  files  are  saved  in  a  form
                   compatible  with  standard data files, and can
                   be read into PROFILE as saved  data  files  if
                   desired.

                   If no answer is given in response  to  "ON  OR
                   OFF?", the current setting remains in effect.

                   A single numeric argument following "ON" saves
                   a single data variable.  Two numeric arguments
                   will save all data variables between  the  two
                   indicated variable numbers.

                       USER DEFINED RULES





          In order to utilize a PRODEP data  file  and  a  PROREP
     report  file to produce a series of specified forecasts, the
     user should describe a set of rules relating the data to the
     report:


             - All data variables are referenced by "D(NO)".   In
               other  words,  the  first  data variable is called
               D(1).

             - All report lines are referenced  by  "R(NO)".   In
               other words, the first report line is called R(1).



          The rules file should be entered through  any  standard
     system editor, and should conform to formatting requirements
     of standard fortran.   The  user  can  use  any  Fortran  IV
     statement*  to  relate  the  "D's"  to the "R's", and should
     group these statements into two required subroutines:



          (1) SUBROUTINE  SETUP:  This  subroutine  contains  all
     statements which initialize report lines, or other variables
     at the start of a forecast.  An example might be a statement
     setting  a  "TOTAL  MARKET" report line variable equal to an
     initial starting level as specified by a "1971 MARKET"  data
     variable.  The SETUP subroutine would appear as follows:

   * any I/O from within the user's SETUP and  RULES  subroutines
     is subject to the following constraints:

            1. Only one logical unit open at a time.  Release the
               unit between IFILE and OFILE operations.

            2. Any logical unit opened  by  the  user  should  be
               released prior to returning to PROFILE control.

            3. Do not use logical unit 1 if a route file has been
               opened, unless user output is to be written to the
               route file.

            4. The logical unit to which PROFILE output  will  be
               printed  (console=5, route file=1) can be found in
               "IOUNIT" in the named COMMON /PROZZZ/.

     R(1) = D(1)
     RETURN
     END



          (2) SUBROUTINE  RULES:  This  subroutine  contains  all
     statements  which  relate  report  line  variables  to  data
     variables  throughout  the  entire  time  horizon   of   the
     forecast.   The  RULES  subroutine  is generally much longer
     than the SETUP subroutine, although this  need  not  be  the
     case.   After  the SETUP subroutine initializes variables as
     desired,  the  RULES  subroutine  generates   the   required
     forecasts  for  the  first  column  in  the  standard output
     report.  After the first column has been filled,  the  RULES
     subroutine  is  used  again to generate the second column of
     forecasts, and so on until each column or  "period"  in  the
     time horizon has been forecast.  If the forecast has 10 time
     periods, the "period rules" are executed 10 times  in  order
     to  complete  the  forecast.   All  report  variables remain
     undisturbed except as modified by the user in  the  "rules".
     In  this  way,  values  can be "passed" from one output time
     period to the next.  For example, in order to calculate  the
     "TOTAL  MARKET" report line for a period, one might multiply
     the "TOTAL MARKET" report line passed from the  last  period
     by one plus a "growth rate" data variable:


               R(1) = R(1) * (1.0+D(2))


     Other relationships within the  rules  section  may  involve
     relating  variables  to other report lines or data variables
     which are not directly related to the last time period.  For
     example,  an  "ABC  SALES" report line variable might be set
     equal to the "TOTAL MARKET" report line  multiplied  by  the
     "ABC SHARE" data variable:


               R(3) = R(1) * D(3)


     If this statement is  executed  after  the  first  statement
     shown  above,  R(3)  will  be  directly related to the newly
     calculated value of R(1)  rather  than  the  value  of  R(1)
     passed from the last period.

          Throughout  the  entire  process  of  forecasting  each
     column of the output report via the "period rules", the data
     variables  are  updated  automatically  by   PROFILE.    For

                                                    PAGE  96
                                                    PROFILE


     example, an "ABC SHARE" data variable which was defined as a
     vector, will have a different value for each  cycle  through
     the  "period rules" subroutine, and the equation shown below
     simply places these  changing  values  into  a  report  line
     variable "ABC SHARE":


               R(2) = D(3)


     Since D(3)  is  automatically  changed  as  each  column  is
     forecast,  R(2)  will  take  on  the  current  value of D(3)
     according to the column being forecast.   A  complete  RULES
     subroutine would appear as follows:


     SUBROUTINE RULES
     COMMON /PROZZZ/ ISEED,NTRIAL,ITRIAL,NPER,IPER,PVRATE,FVRATE,
  +  R(100),D(500),KILRUN,KILTRI,KILPER,IOUNIT,DFILE(2),RFILE(2)
     R(1) = R(1) * (1.0+D(2))
     R(2) = D(3)
     R(3) = R(1) * D(3)
     R(4) = R(3) * D(4)
     R(5) = R(3) * D(5)
     R(6) = D(6)
     R(7) = D(7)
     R(8) = R(3) - R(4) - R(5) - R(6) - R(7)
     R(9) = R(8) * D(8)
     R(10) = R(8) - R(9)
     R(11) = R(10) + R(7)
     R(12) = D(9)
     R(13) = R(11) + R(12)
     RETURN
     END



          In  order  that  the  user's  "rules"  can  communicate
     information to PROFILE and vice versa, a named COMMON should
     be included at  the  start  of  both  SUBROUTINE  RULES  and
     SUBROUTINE SETUP:


     COMMON /PROZZZ/ ISEED,NTRIAL,ITRIAL,NPER,IPER,PVRATE,FVRATE,
  +  R(100),D(500),KILRUN,KILTRI,KILPER,IOUNIT,DFILE(2),RFILE(2) 

     Where:

     ISEED = Current value of random number seed

     NTRIAL = Total number of monte carlo simulation trials

          PAGE  97
          PROFILE


     ITRIAL = Current monte carlo trial number

     NPER = Total no.  of columns or "periods" in the forecast

     IPER = Current column or "period" being forecast

     PVRATE = Present value rate specified by PV specifications

     FVRATE = Future value rate specified by FV specifications

     R(100) = Report line variables

     D(500) = Data variables

     KILRUN* = Flag to kill run and return to "NEXT?"

     KILTRI* = Flag to kill trials and print results

     KILPER* = Flag to stop forecasting columns  ("periods")  and
               continue   to   next   trial  if  more  than  one.
               Remaining columns will assume all R's =  zero  for
               the remainder of the trial.

     IOUNIT = Logical unit to which output is routed

     DFILE(2) = Data file name and extension (left justified)

     RFILE(2) = Report file name and extension (left justified)


          This COMMON can be typed in by the  user  or  retrieved
     from system library where it can be found as:


               (CC)COMPAR.COM


          The user should  observe  one  naming  convention  when
     assigning  names  to  any  user written subroutines or named
     COMMONs:


               The name of any SUBROUTINE  or  named  COMMON
               written by the user should not end in "ZZZ".


          Avoiding "ZZZ"  endings  will  eliminate  any  possible
     naming  conflict  with  SUBROUTINEs  and COMMONs internal to
     PROFILE.


   * 0 = continue unaffected
     1 = kill and proceed as described

          Normally PROFILE output reports are calculated directly
     using  R's.   Since  floating  point  arithmetic may lead to
     rounding discrepancies on reports,  the  user  may  wish  to
     structure   his   rules  using  integer  variables  for  all
     calculations.  The appropriate integer results would then be
     copied  into the R's so that they would appear on the output
     reports.  Of course integer variables place a definite limit
     on  the  size  of  values which might be displayed, but most
     applications will fall well within this limit.

          Both the SETUP and RULES subroutines should be  entered
     on  a single file.  The file name can be any legal file name
     chosen by the user, in order to distinguish  different  sets
     of "rules" from each other.  (A file extension ".SAV" should
     be avoided since this extension is used  for  saved  PROFILE
     models.  See PROFILE DUMP command.)

          The rules can be checked for typing errors, etc., prior
     to  executing  the  entire  PROFILE program by compiling the
     subroutines (MYRULES) with the following monitor command:



          .COM MYRULES
          F-IV: MYRULES
           SETUP
           RULES

          EXIT
            
          -




          To run the PROFILE program, along with the user defined
     rules (MYRULES) the following monitor command is given:



          -R (CC)PROFILE

          PROFILE

          RULES FILE NAME? MYRULES
          F-IV: MYRULES

          EXECUTION

          DATA FILE NAME?

          PAGE  99
          PROFILE


          Saved PROFILE  models  can  also  be  created  via  the
     PROFILE DUMP command, and can be run by specifying the RULES
     file with the extension .SAV:



          -R (CC)PROFILE

          PROFILE

          RULES FILE NAME? MYRULES.SAV

          DATA FILE NAME?




          A PROFILE model which  has  been  saved  via  the  DUMP
     command  is  quicker  and  more  efficient  to start.  It is
     usually most convenient to utilize this procedure once a set
     of  rules  has been tested and the user is making changes to
     data variables or report specifications rather than  changes
     to the rules.

                   Risk analysis with PROFILE





          Using PROFILE to run a  monte  carlo  simulation  is  a
     direct  extension  of  normal  report  generation.   PROFILE
     performs a monte carlo simulation by averaging many  "trial"
     forecasts.   each  trial  is  identical to a single forecast
     except that data  variables  can  take  on  different  trial
     values from within a specified range.

          At the start of each trial forecast, probabilistic data
     variables   are   assigned   values   "sampled"  from  their
     associated  probability  distribution.   Deterministic  data
     variables  (constants and vectors) will be assigned the same
     value at the start of each trial.  Thus the results  of  one
     trial   forecast   represent  one  possible  set  of  future
     occurences.  The next  trial  forecast  which  is  run  will
     represent  another  possible  set  of future occurences.  If
     many trials are  run,  the  results  of  all  trials  should
     represent  a  reasonable  cross-section  or "PROFILE" of all
     possible combinations of uncertainties about the future.

          When a monte carlo simulation is run,  the  results  of
     all  trials  are  averaged  to generate the standard report,
     which then represents the average of all  possible  futures.
     Yet  additional  information  has  been gained via the monte
     carlo  simulation  procedure.   From  the  profile  of   all
     futures,  the  decision  maker  can  better  understand  the
     extremes of what might happen  in  the  future  -  in  other
     words,  how  "good"  he  might  expect  the future to be, or
     conversely, how "bad" it might  be.   The  chances  that  an
     output  variable  might  attain  a  future value are readily
     computed by PROFILE and shown to the user in the form  of  a
     "Risk  Profile".   These  same  principles  can  be  used to
     generate risk profiles of present value calculations, future
     value calculations, or internal rates of return.

          To perform a risk analysis with PROFILE, the user  must
     first  decide  which  data  variables  should  be defined to
     include uncertainty.  Significant factors in  this  decision
     are  consideration  of  how  much each input might vary, and
     what this variability might mean on key criteria  chosen  by
     the user.  For example, a variable which is highly uncertain
     and will have significant impact on the chosen criteria, may
     be   best   expressed  as  a  probabilistic  data  variable.
     (Conversely, an uncertain data variable with  little  impact
     may  more profitably be left as a fixed input.) The decision
     maker can use PROFILE, varying fixed inputs to gain a better
     understanding of the critical uncertain data variables.

          PAGE 101
          PROFILE


          Once the uncertain data variables have  been  expressed
     by  the  user,  and  he  has selected key output report risk
     profiles, the risk analysis forecast is started in the  same
     way as a point-estimate forecast:


          -R (CC)PROFILE

          PROFILE

          RULES FILE NAME? MYRULES
          F-IV: MYRULES
           SETUP
           RULES
          LOADING
          EXECUTION

          DATA FILE NAME? ABC.DAT

          REPORT FILE NAME? ABC.REP

          RUN ID?

          NEXT?



          Prior to running,  the  risk  analysis  user  sets  the
     number of "trial" forecasts to be run:



          NEXT? TRIALS

          TRIALS = 50

          NEXT? RUN


                            ABC CORPORATION
                    10 YEAR PROFIT & LOSS FORECAST...


          NEXT?




          The number of trials will remain set to  the  specified
     amount  until  reset  to  a  new  value.  There does exist a
     trade-off the user must consider when setting the number  of
     trials.   More  trials  mean more observations of the future
     and more precise profiles.  Yet  the  run  time  also  rises

                                                    PAGE 102
                                                    PROFILE


     proportionally  to  the  number of trials, and there is some
     point at which more trials  may  contribute  less  than  the
     cost.

          Between trials, all "R" variables  are  initialized  to
     zero  so  that each trial starts identically.  All uncertain
     "D's" are assigned sampled values at  the  same  time.   The
     user can also specify that an uncertain data variable should
     be assigned a new value as each column or  "period"  of  the
     forecast is begun.  (This specification is accomplished with
     the "*" when defining the data variable.  See  "PRODEP  data
     types".)  Thus the * denotes independence of a data variable
     value from  one  period  to  the  next,  while  the  default
     procedure   assumes  a  data  value  will  remain  the  same
     throughout the time horizon of a single trial forecast:































          In addition to the automatic sampling of uncertain data
     variables  provided  by  PROFILE,  the user has available an
     auxillary subroutine to sample data  variables  as  he  sees
     fit.   The  call  to  "SUBROUTINE  SAMPLE"  can be made from
     either the SETUP subroutine or the RULES subroutine:

          PAGE 103
          PROFILE


                    CALL SAMPLE(N) 


     The single integer argument  should  be  set  equal  to  the
     number  of  the data variable for which a new value is to be
     sampled.

          SUBROUTINE SAMPLE can be used to sample data  variables
     when  the sampling must take place after related information
     becomes available.  For example,  the  user  may  define  an
     uncertain  data variable representing the number of customer
     orders in a year,  and  another  variable  representing  the
     amount  of a single order.  Only after PROFILE has sampled a
     value for the number of orders can the amount of each  order
     be sampled.  The user could control the sampling as follows:


               TOTVAL = 0
               NORDER = D(1)
               DO 10 N = 1, NORDER
               CALL SAMPLE(2)
            10 TOTVAL = TOTVAL + D(2)



          In this example, the user has accumulated a total value
     (TOTVAL)  of  all  orders  by  sampling D(2), the value of a
     single order, once for each order.

          Another reason for referencing SUBROUTINE SAMPLE is  to
     sample  two  or more uncertain data variables using the same
     random number seed:


               ISAVE = ISEED
               CALL SAMPLE(3)
               ISEED = ISAVE
               CALL SAMPLE(4)



          In this example, the user has saved the  random  number
     seed  prior  to sampling D(3), so that D(4) could be sampled
     with the same  seed.   Therefore,  D(3)  and  D(4)  will  be
     directly  related  to  each other after these statements are
     executed.

          SUBROUTINE SAMPLE (explained in the  previous  section)
     and  several other helpful subroutines are made available to
     the user's rules.  If a rules file references one  of  these
     routines, the routine in question is automatically loaded by
     PROFILE when the  user's  model  is  loaded.   Some  of  the
     routines in the PROFILE library include:

            1. GETDEP  to  calculate  straight  line,   declining
               balance, or sum-of-years depreciation schedules.

            2. GETBIN to read in a special PROFILE binary  report
               file.

            3. SETBIN to enter  reports  constructed  via  GETBIN
               into  the PROFILE output report area for output by
               PROFILE.

            4. SAMPLE  to  sample  data  variables.    See   risk
               analysis with PROFILE.

                     PROFILE RESPONSE FILES




          The PROFILE/PROREP/PRODEP system permits  the  user  to
     enter  terminal  responses  from  an input console or from a
     response  file.   Response  files  can  be  created  in  any
     standard  system editor (for example TECO or EDITOR) and may
     contain line sequence numbers:

             - Response  files  must  begin  with   the   keyword
               *RESPONSE.

             - Any   blank   lines   will   be   interpreted   as
               significant, i.e.  as blank terminal responses.

             - Standard system protection codes can  be  used  to
               protect files as necessary.

             - Any response  file  line  can  be  continued  onto
               another line by including an "&" at the end of the
               line.

             - If  line  sequence  numbers   exist,   the   first
               character   after  the  sequence  number  will  be
               ignored.

             - Response files may not  reference  other  response
               files.

             - Response  files  can  be  opened  by  one  PROFILE
               program  (i.e.   PROFILE,  PROREP, or PRODEP), and
               can transfer control to any other program  without
               interruption.


          To begin entering responses from a response  file,  the
     user  should  enter  an  "@"  followed  by  the file name in
     response to any  PROFILE/PROREP/PRODEP  inquiry.   Responses
     will then be taken from the indicated file until:

            1. the end of the response file is reached, or

            2. an  error  in  a  response  from   the   file   is
               encountered.   (In  case  of  an  error, the error
               message and the response  file  line  causing  the
               error are indicated.)


          While a response file is  open,  all  terminal  I/O  is

     resumed with the next inquiry in the normal input sequence.

          Response files can be  any  length,  and  may  be  used
     continuously  between  PROFILE,  PROREP,  and PRODEP without
     interruption.   Each  program  will  automatically  pick  up
     taking  responses  from  an  open response file at the point
     that the previous program stopped taking responses from  the
     file.

     program only:


             Form: ^N


      Description: The  up-arrow  allows  a  user  to  alter  the
                   sequence of requests for specifications.  N is
                   the number of the  particular  line  the  user
                   wants   to  enter  or  correct.   PROREP  then
                   returns to the specification request where  it
                   originally left off.

                OUTPUT REPORTS AND THEIR MEANINGS




                     Standard Report Format
































          The standard report is a matrix  of  values  calculated
     for  each  specified row over the specified number of output
     columns or time periods.  If a  monte  carlo  simulation  is
     run,  the  values  shown on the standard report are the mean
     values calculated during the trial forecasts.  

          If more columns are specified than can be shown in  one
     pass,  the  subsequent  sets  appear  below  with the column
     titles and row names repeated.

          The number of decimal places shown on output is set  by
     the  user  when specifying the row names (see "DEC =" option
     in description of PROREP).  The default  number  of  decimal
     places is two.  The user can also specify that 5 significant
     digits should be shown on an output row.  If a numeric field

                                                    PAGE 116



     is  larger  than can be shown, the following conventions are
     observed:


            1. If the user has specified  a  specific  number  of
               decimal places (or defaulted to 2), the field will
               be shown as "***".

            2. If the  user  has  specified  that  5  significant
               digits should be shown, the field will be shown in
               E format.

          This  example  demonstrates  seven   other   formatting
     options provided the user.


                1.  $ option can be specified to cause "$" to  be
                    printed as the leading character of a numeric
                    field.

                2.  % option can be specified to cause "%" to  be
                    printed   as  the  trailing  character  of  a
                    numeric field.

                3.  ( option can be used to specify that negative
                    values should be enclosed in parentheses.

                4.  COMMA option can be used to include commas in
                    output   fields   to   designate   thousands,
                    millions, etc.

                5.  SKIP = option can be used to skip a specified
                    number  of lines after an output row has been
                    printed.

                6.  ULINE =  option can  be  specified  to  cause
                    single   or  double  underlining  of  numeric
                    fields after an output row has been  printed.
                    (Underlining always precedes any skipping).

                7.  NULL option can  be  used  to  cause  numeric
                    fields  with  a  value  of zero to be omitted
                    from an output row.

          Each of these options can be specified by the user when
     entering a row name.  (See detailed description of PROREP).




                     Standard Risk Profiles




          The PROFILE system will calculate and  display  a  risk
     profile  (cumulative  probability curve) for any item on the
     standard report.  The item to be profiled is specified  with
     the row number and column number when the report is defined.

          When running a monte carlo  simulation  with  intervals
     set from 1 to 99, the risk profile report is shown as in the
     example below:

               STD DEV                30.41



          The default on intervals is 4 (quartiles) as are  shown
     above.   Cumulative  probabilities  are  shown  to 4 places,
     while the forecasted  values  are  shown  according  to  the
     number  of  decimals specified by the user when defining the
     row or column.  (Note also, that using the $, %, (, or comma
     option  while  defining  a  row  or  column  will  produce a
     corresponding $, %,  (),  or  comma  on  any  risk  profiles
     associated   with   that  row  or  column.)  The  cumulative
     probability distribution which is displayed is calculated by
     smoothing  a  curve  (a  series  of  straight line segments)
     through the observed  results  for  the  forecasted  values.
     (See  "Risk  Profile  Smoothing".)  The  average  (mean)  is
     calculated as:







     The standard deviation is calculated as:








          If a risk profile is produced as a result of running  a
     deterministic,  single  trial  forecast,  or  as a result of
     running a monte carlo simulation with intervals = 0, a short
     form  profile  report  is  produced.   This report shows the
     average value forecast for the item (the same information as
     on the standard report.) An example follows:

                        1320.00



          The "$", "%", "(", "comma", and "DEC=" row  and  column
     options  also  control  formating  of any short form profile
     values associated with a row and column, in the same way  as
     the standard risk profile.  (Also see "Risk Profile Graphs")




                      Present Value Reports




          The PROFILE  system  will  calculate  and  display  the
     present  value  of  from  1  to  5 output report rows.  When
     running a deterministic,  single  trial  forecast,  or  when
     running  a monte carlo simulation with PV intervals = 0, the
     present value report appears as in the following example:


                    PRESENT VALUE
                    FOR ROWS: 11 12
                    AT RATE  10 %

                      
                            249



          When running a monte carlo  simulation  with  intervals
     set  from  1  to  99, the present value report is shown as a
     risk profile.  The default on intervals is 4 (quartiles), as
     in the example below:

          Cumulative probabilities are shown to 4  places,  while
     the  present  value  is  shown  to the nearest integer.  The
     cumulative probability distribution which  is  displayed  is
     calculated  by  smoothing a curve (a series of straight line
     segments) through the observed  trial  results  for  present
     value.   (See  "Risk profile smoothing".) The average (mean)
     is calculated as:







     The standard deviation is calculated as:







     Each trial present value is calculated as:








          The cash flow can  be  specified  by  the  user  to  be
     DISCRETE  (discounted  from  the  end  of  each  output time
     period), CONTINUOUS (discounted as uniform flows  throughout
     each  output time period), or BDISCRETE (discounted from the
     beginning of each output time  period).   In  addition,  the

          PAGE 121



     user  can  specify  the  time in years that each output time
     period represents,  if  the  default  of  one  year  is  not
     appropriate, (Also see "Risk Profile Graphs".)




                      Future Value Reports




          The PROFILE  system  will  calculate  and  display  the
     future  value  of  from  1  to  5  output report rows.  When
     running a deterministic,  single  trial  forecast,  or  when
     running  a monte carlo simulation with FV intervals = 0, the
     future value report appears as in the following example:


                    FUTURE VALUE
                    FOR ROWS: 11 12
                    AT RATE  10 %

                      
                            646



          When running a monte carlo  simulation  with  intervals
     set from 1 to 99, the future value report is shown as a risk
     profile.  The default on intervals is 4  (quartiles)  as  in
     the example below:


               PROBABILITY      FUTURE VALUE
               OF VALUE         FOR ROWS: 11 12

     cumulative probability distribution which  is  displayed  is
     calculated  by  smoothing a curve (a series of straight line
     segments) through the  observed  trial  results  for  future

     each  output time period), or BDISCRETE (compounded from the
     beginning of each output time  period).   In  addition,  the
     user  can  specify  the  time in years that each output time
     period represents,  if  the  default  of  one  year  is  not
     appropriate, (Also see "Risk Profile Graphs".)




                           ROI Reports




          The PROFILE system will calculate and  display  an  ROI
     report  of  from  1 to 5 output report rows.  When running a
     deterministic, single trial  forecast,  or  when  running  a
     monte  carlo  simulation  with  ROI  intervals  = 0, the ROI
     report shows the internal rate of return which will discount
     the cash flows of the chosen rows to zero:

                          54.49 %



          If the above example was  produced  by  a  monte  carlo
     simulation,  the  cash  flows  of  the  chosen rows were the
     average cash flows found for all trials.  The  ROI  rate  is
     the rate which discounts these "averages" to zero.

          When running a monte carlo  simulation  with  intervals
     set from 1 to 99, the ROI report is shown as a risk profile.

          Cumulative probabilities are shown to 4  places,  while
     the  ROI  is shown to two decimal places, and is in the form
     of a %.  The cumulative probability  distribution  which  is
     displayed  is  calculated  by smoothing a curve (a series of
     straight line segments) through the observed  trial  results
     for ROI.  (See "Risk Profile Smoothing".) The average (mean)
     is calculated as:

     The standard deviation is calculated as:








          The ROI of average is the same as  the  ROI  calculated
     for  the  short  form  of  the  ROI report (the first of the
     preceding examples).  It is the  rate  which  discounts  the
     "averages" of all cash flows to zero.

          Each trial ROI is that value which  will  discount  all
     cash  flows  to  zero  according  to  the following discount
     equation:








          The cash flow can  be  specified  by  the  user  to  be
     DISCRETE  (discounted  from  the  end  of  each  output time
     period), CONTINUOUS (discounted as uniform flows  throughout
     each  output time period), or BDISCRETE (discounted from the
     beginning of each output time  period).   In  addition,  the
     user  can  specify  the  time in years that each output time
     period represents,  if  the  default  of  one  year  is  not
     appropriate, (Also see "Risk Profile Graphs".)

          Each of the possible  risk  profile  reports  (standard
     risk  profiles,  PV,  FV,  and ROI reports) can be displayed
     with a graph of the cumulative or mass probability curve, by
     specifying  the "GRAPH" option when defining the report.  An
     example risk profile graph is shown below:

                     Risk Profile Smoothing




          Risk profile reports produced by PROFILE are calculated
     by  smoothing a series of straight line segments through the
     observed trial results.  If a 10 trial monte carlo simulaton
     produced   the   following   observations,   the  cumulative
     probability curve for the observations  would  be  the  step
     curve shown below:

                                                    PAGE 128



          In order to smooth a curve through the steps,  each  of
     the  plateaus  is bisected.  The critical assumption here is
     that the observed value lies in the center of a  "group"  of
     possible  values  which  could  occur between the next lower
     group and the next higher group.  Similarly, the next  lower
     value  lies  in  the center of its group of possible values,
     and the curve is smoothed as follows:









































          Notice that the  "tails"  of  the  smoothed  cumulative
     probability  curve  are  extrapolated on either end, through
     the middle of  the  step.   Extrapolation  can  occasionally
     cause  values  for  the extremes of a profile to be slightly
     below or above what the user knows the true extremes to be.

                  DATA TYPES AND THEIR MEANINGS




           CONSTANT A single fixed value which will be  available
                    to  the  user in a D(NO) during the execution
                    of  the  SETUP  subroutine  and   the   RULES
                    subroutine.

             VECTOR A series of fixed values, one for each column
                    or  forecast time period in the time horizon.
                    The first value will be available to the user
                    in  a D(NO) during the execution of the SETUP
                    subroutine and the  first  pass  through  the
                    RULES  subroutine.  Subsequent passes through
                    the "period rules",  provide  the  succeeding
                    values in the D(NO).  If the series of values
                    contains fewer values than columns, the  last
                    value  in  the  series  is maintained for all
                    passes through the "period rules" beyond that
                    point.

           DISCRETE A discrete probability distribution expressed
                    as  incremental  probability versus value.  A
                    discrete data variable is always sampled (via
                    an  internal uniform random number generator)
                    prior to execution of the  SETUP  subroutine,
                    and  is  available  to the user in a D(NO) at
                    this point and in the RULES  subroutine.   If
                    the  discrete data variable is specified with
                    an  *,  a  new  value  is  sampled  prior  to
                    subsequent  passes through the "period rules"
                    so that the D(NO) takes on a different  value
                    for  each  column or time period.  A discrete
                    variable has a likelihood of taking  on  each
                    specified  value  equal  to  the  probability
                    associated with each value.  No values  other
                    than the exact specified values can occur:

                                                    PAGE 130



         CONTINUOUS A   continuous    probability    distribution
                    expressed  as a cumulative probability versus
                    value.  A continuous data variable is  always
                    sampled   (via  an  internal  uniform  random
                    number generator) prior to execution  of  the
                    SETUP  subroutine,  and  is  available to the
                    user in a D(NO) at  this  point  and  in  the
                    RULES  subroutine.   If  the  continuous data
                    variable is specified with an *, a new  value
                    is sampled prior to subsequent passes through
                    the "period rules" so that the D(NO) takes on
                    a  different  value  for  each column or time
                    period.  A continuous variable can take on  a
                    value  equal  to  or less than each specified
                    value  with  a  likelihood   given   by   the
                    specified probability.  Any value between the
                    0.0 probability point and the 1.0 probability
                    point  can occur.  The cumulative probability
                    curve used for this interpolation is a set of
                    straight  line  segments  drawn  through  the
                    specified probability points.  The  tails  of
                    the  distribution  are extrapolated using the
                    slope of the two adjacent probability points:

          PAGE 131



             NORMAL A normal probability  distribution  expressed
                    as the mean and standard deviation.  A normal
                    data  variable  is  always  sampled  (via  an
                    internal   normal  random  number  generator)
                    prior to execution of the  SETUP  subroutine,
                    and  is  available  to the user in a D(NO) at
                    this point and in the RULES  subroutine.   If
                    the normal data variable is specified with an
                    *, a new value is sampled prior to subsequent
                    passes through the "period rules" so that the
                    D(NO) takes on a  different  value  for  each
                    column   or   time  period.   A  normal  data
                    variable  can  take  on  any   value   within
                    approximately  +/-  3  standard deviations of
                    the mean.  The approximate likelihood that  a
                    sampled  value  will  occur  within  specific
                    ranges is shown below:
















              TREND A series of values  joining  two  other  data
                    variable  values,  assuming one data variable
                    value in some beginning column or time period
                    (default=1) and the other data variable value
                    in  some  ending  column   or   time   period
                    (default=last  period).   Both  the beginning
                    data variable and the  ending  data  variable
                    must  be  constant,  discrete, continuous, or
                    normal data variables, and  will  be  sampled
                    dependently.   A  value  interpolated along a
                    straight line between the two  endpoint  data
                    values  will be made available to the user in
                    a D(NO) during the  execution  of  the  SETUP
                    subroutine  and  each  pass through the RULES
                    subroutine:

                    values  for  periods  between  the  beginning
                    D(NO) and ending  D(NO),  the  straight  line
                    interpolation    is    shifted   toward   the
                    midpoints.  The actual points  used  are  the
                    midpoints    specified    +/-    an    amount
                    corresponding to  the  difference  between  a
                    straight  line through the sampled end values
                    and another straight line through the  median
                    end  values.   Midpoints for periods prior to
                    the beginning D(NO) or after the ending D(NO)
                    set  the trend variable to the specific value
                    of the midpoint.  thus deterministic data can
                    be  specified  outside the "beginning-ending"
                    D(NO) range:

        MULTVARIATE A data variable which is related directly  to
                    another    data   variable   via   a   linear
                    relationship which can contain  probabilistic
                    terms.   (For example a regression equation.)
                    The form of the relationship is:


                    Multivariate = A + B x Independent + E



                         "A" is a constant term which can be made
                    probabilistic   by   expressing   a  non-zero
                    variance for "A".  "B" is the coefficient  of
                    the independent data variable and can be made
                    probabilistic  by   expressing   a   non-zero

                    variance  for "B".  "E" is the variance of an
                    error term with mean  =  0.   In  addition  a
                    covariance   between   "A"  and  "B"  can  be
                    expressed.  If variances are expressed,  they
                    are  combined  into  a single variance, whose
                    square root becomes the standard deviation of
                    a   single  normally  distributed  term  with
                    mean=0:
