        THERE IS A GREATER DEMAND FOR WELL TRAINED COSMETOLOGISTS TO-
        DAY, THAN THERE HAS BEEN IN THE PAST.  IT CAN BE, AND IS A VERY
        LUCRATIVE PROFESSION.  TODAY YOU ARE CONSIDERED AN ARTIST AND A
        --------------------
        PROFESSIONAL.

        AS A PROFESSIONAL CAREER, COSMETOLOGY OFFERS MANY OPPORTUNITIES,
        THE REWARDS ARE MANY AND FULFILLING, TO THOSE STUDENTS WHO RE-
                                 ----------
        CEIVE A THOROUGH TRAINING; HAVE DEVELOPED AN ATTRACTIVE APPEAR-
        ANCE, A CHARMING PERSONALITY AND WHO OBSERVE PROFESSIONAL
        ETHICS.  ETHICS DEAL WITH PROPER CONDUCT AND BUSINESS DEALINGS
        OF COSMETOLOGISTS IN RELATION TO THEIR EMPLOYER, PATRONS, AND
        CO-WORKERS.

        NAIL IRREGULARITIES AND BLEMISHES CAN BE CARED FOR BY THE MAN-

        AND PUS FORMATION, THESE ARE REFERRED TO A PHYSICIAN.  IT IS
        IMPORTANT THAT THE MANICURIST BE FAMILIAR WITH THESE TWO CON-
        DITIONS.

HAND AND ARM MASSAGE IN MANICURING
----------------------------------

        MASSAGE IS ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST USEFUL METHODS OF
        PHYSICAL TREATMENT.  IN COSMETOLOGY IT IS ALSO EMPLOYED
        FOR REASONS OF HEALTH AND BEAUTY.  THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED
        BY MEANS OF THE HANDS AND ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES.

BENEFITS OF MASSAGE:
-------------------
        1-STIMULATES THE MUSCLES.
        2-STIMULATES THE NERVES.
        3-STIMULATES CIRCULATION OF BLOOD AND LYMPH.
        4-RELAXES THE MUSCLE TENSION.
        5-REDUCES FAT CELLS.
        6-STIMULATES THE GLANDS AND SUPPLIES NATURAL OIL TO THE SKIN.
        7-HELPS CLEANSE AND NOURISH THE SKIN.

PRINCIPAL MOVEMENTS OF MASSAGE:
------------------------------
        1-EFFLEURAGE: LIGHT STROKING MOVEMENTS WITH PALMS OF HANDS
          ----------
        AND FINGERS.  SOOTHING TO THE NERVES.
        2-PETRISSAGE: DEEP NEADING OR PINCHING MOVEMENT WITH PALMS OF 
          ----------
        HANDS AND FINGERS.  VERY BENEFICIAL TO DRY SKIN.
        3-FRICTION: DEEP, HEAVY MASSAGE WITH CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE
          --------
        OF THE HANDS.
        4-TAP0TEMENT: QUICK, FIRM, SLAPPING OR TAPPING MOVEMENT WITH
          ----------
        FINGERS OR EDGE OF HANDS.  VERY STIMULATING TO DEEPER TISSUE.
        5-VIBRATION: GENTLE VIBRATORY MOVEMENT GIVEN BY THE HANDS
           ---------
        OR ELECTRICAL VIBRATOR.  VERY STIMULATING.
        6-WRINGING: A TWISTING MOVEMENT WITH PRESSURE OF ENTIRE HAND.
          --------

TEST:
----
        1-WHAT MOVEMENT IS MOST SOOTHING TO PATRON?
        2-WHAT MOVEMENT IS USED MOST IN HAND AND ARM MASSAGE?
        3-WHEN SHOULD A HAND AND ARM MASSAGE NOT BE GIVEN?
