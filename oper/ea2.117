                                        (REF: E.A.2.117)


VERSION 1.00 OF SETTERM FOR THE PDP-10:


THIS IS THE INITIAL RELEASE OF SETTERM FOR THE PDP-10.
IT IS  MIRROR IMAGE OF SETTERM FOR THE 940.

IMPORTANT:   THE COMMAND 'SETTER' SHOULD BE PUT INTO THE MONITOR
DISPATCH TABLE AS A COMMAND WHICH CALLS A PROGRAM FROM SYS:
THIS WILL TAKE 3 OR 4 WORDS OF MONITOR TABLE SPACE.  THIS IS THE
ONLY WAY THAT THE USER WILL BE ABLE TO TYPE

        -SETTERM INPUT,OUTPUT [HUSH]

IN THE EXECUTIVE.  THE OTHER ALTERNATE (AND, I MIGHT ADD THE
ONLY ONE) CALL IS

        -R[UN] SETTER

THE PROGRAM WILL PROMPT WITH

        PARAMETERS:

AND WILL WAIT FOR INPUT HERE.

CONTACT ME FOR ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS.
