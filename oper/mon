2.6  FILE MANIPULATION COMMANDS

Some of the following commands perform complex functions requiring a num-
ber of commands on a less sophisticated system.  The commands below list
the user's files and file directories, rename and delete files, provide
remote control of DECtapes, allocate disk space, and manipulate job search
lists.

     TYPE (TY)

Function

     The TYPE command directs PIP (Peripheral Interchange Program) to type
     the contents of the named source file(s) on the user's Teletype.

     To stop the typing, type %C twice.

Command Format

     TYPE list 

          list = a signle file specification or a string of file specifi-
          cations separated by commas.  This argument is required.

          A file specification may consist of a filename (with or without
          an extension), a device name if the source file is not on disk,
          a project-programmer number, if the source file is not in the
          user's disk area, and a protection.

          Examples of file specifications:
                PROG, PROGl.MAC,
                DTA3:PROG2,PROG4  l0,l61

          In addition, the *construction may be used as follows:

                filename.*     All files with this filename and any extension.
                *.ext          All files with this extension and any filename.
                *.*            All files

Characteristics

     The TYPE command:

          leaves the console in monitor mode,
          runs the COMPIL CUSP,
          is used with disk monitors only,
          requires LOGIN.

          -

     LIST (LI)

Function   

     The LIST command directs PIP to list contents of named source
     file(s) on the line printer (LPT).

Command Format

     LIST list
 
          list = a single file specification or a string of file speci-
          fications separated by commas.  This argument is required.

Characteristics

     The LIST command:

          leaves the console in monitor mode,
          runs the COMPIL CUSP,
          is used with disk monitors only,
          requires LOGIN.

     R PRINT

Function

     The R PRINT command queues files upon the disk to be printed when the
     line printer is available.

Command Format

     R PRINT

          The user types in the names of the files to be printed, separated
          by commas.
          Only disk devices may be specified.  If no device is specified,
          DSK is assumed.  A particular ifle structure may be specified 
          when there is more than one file with the same name if different
          file structures.  Filenames may be continued on the next line by
          typing a hyphen followed by a carriage return.  To delete a file
          after it is printed, insert the /D switch after the filename.  To
          preserve a file that PRINTR would normally delete, in sert the /P
          switch after the filename.  To make more than one copy of the file,
          type a number from 2 to 9 as a switch.

Characteristics

     The R PRINT command:

          places the console in user mode,
          runs the PRINTR CUSP,
          requires a job number and LOGIN.

     DIRECT (DIR)

Function

     The DIRECT command lists the directory entries (filename, filename
     extension, size in blocks written, protection if file is on disk,
     and date created) specified by list.

Command Format

     DIRECT list

            list=a single file specification or a string of file
            specifications separated by commas.  This argument is
            optional.

            If list is omitted, DSK:*.* is assumed, and the 
            directories in all file structures as defined by the job
            search list are listed, starting with the file structure
            name as a header.

            Two switches may be used with the DIRECT command:

               /F    Lists short form of directory (i.e., filename
                     and filename extension only).

               /L    Lists on the line printer (LPT) instead of
                     Teletype.

Characteristics

     The DIRECT command:

         leaves the job in monitor mode,
         runs the COMPIL CUSP,
         is used with disk monitors only,
         requires LOGIN.

     FILE (FIL)

Function

     The FILE command provides remote control of DECtape-to-disk and
     disk-to-DEC-tape transfers on operator-handles DECtapes.

Command Format

     FILE option

          option = F  Files information onto a DECtape.  Requires
                      Tape ID and list of filenames as arguments.  The
                      ID is a decimal number (user's tape), P (project tape),
                      or A (general tape).  Upon completion, an automatic
                      FILE L is performed.

          option = Z  Zeros the directory of the DECtape before the files
                      are copied and then performs the same operations
                      as the F option.  After the files are copied, an
                      automatic FILE L is performed.

                      DECtape to the disk.  After the files are transferred,
                      an automatic FILE L is performed.

          option = L  Reads the directory of a DECtape and places it in
                      the user's disk area as an ASCII file with filename
                      tapen.DIR.  Tapen is the number of the user's
                      DECtape and is the only argument.  The user may
                      then read the directory with a monitor command string.
                      (See Examples).

          option = C  Checks the queue of FILE commands to be read to 
                      determine if any of the user's requests are still
                      pending.  No argument is required.  Pending request
                      will be listed.

          option = D  Deletes the specified ifles from DECtape.  Requires
                      Tape ID and list of filenames as arguments.

          The C option is the only request that is performed
          immediately.  The other requests are placed in a queue to be
          performed when possible.  The user's console and jnob are free
          to proceed before the request is completed.  The option argument
          is optional.  If an argument is not specified, a brief dialogue
          is performed.

Characteristics

     The FILE command:

          leaves the console in monitor mode,
          runs the UMOUNT CUSP,
          is used with disk monitors only,
          requires a job number and LOGIN.
